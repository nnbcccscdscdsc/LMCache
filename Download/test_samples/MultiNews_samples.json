    "document": "On his show tonight, Lawrence O’Donnell brought up the GOP’s “Southern strategy” and wondered if part of this strategy was “an appeal to racism and racist voting.” And this led O’Donnell to ask if the Mitt Romney campaign deliberately wanted to get booed by an audience of African-Americans in order to appeal to racist voters. Guest Goldie Taylor told O’Donnell that his assessment was on the mark. \n \n RELATED: Bill O’Reilly And Marc Lamont-Hill Clash Over Fallout From Romney’s NAACP Speech \n \n Taylor said that Romney didn’t go to the NAACP because he wanted to engage with the black community, but he wanted to make a show for small factions of the GOP base. She argued that if Romney was really there to appeal to the NAACP, he would have repudiated voter ID laws, which Eric Holder likened to a “poll tax.” \n \n She said Romney can’t just appeal to the dissatisfactions of African-Americans to get them to vote for him, he needs to walk the walk. \n \n Watch the video below, courtesy of MSNBC: \n \n Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is hinting that all those boos toward Mitt Romney on Wednesday at the NAACP convention may have been exactly what the former governor was counting on. \n \n \n \n “I think it was a calculated move on his part to get booed at the NAACP convention,” Pelosi said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. She did not elaborate further during the three-minute interview clip provided by Bloomberg. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Mitt to NAACP: In my heart, I'm the candidate for you) \n \n \n \n Romney, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, faced a chorus of boos as he vowed before the crowd in Houston to repeal the health care law, the signature domestic policy achievement of President Barack Obama. The law's constitutionality was upheld by the Supreme Court last month. \n \n \n \n Back in Washington, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus wasn’t all too pleased either with Romney’s comments on health care, either. \n \n \n \n “I felt terrible when the booing started, but I also believe that if he’s got any African-Americans in and around his campaign – which I don’t know; if he does, I don’t know any of them -- if he has staff members who vetted that speech or inserted some of the things that I heard, they should be fired,\" Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) told a handful of reporters. “I mean, how in the world would you stand up in front of the NAACP and say that you oppose Obamacare?” \n \n (Also on POLITICO: NAACP whacks Romney hours after speech) \n \n \n \n But Cleaver at least gave Romney an “A” for effort. \n \n \n \n “You know, they call the members of the NAACP African-Americans and the last word is Americans,” Cleaver said. “So they deserve to hear what the presidential candidates are going to say even if they are Republican. And so I give him an A for that.” \n \n Read more about: Nancy Pelosi, Mitt Romney, NAACP ||||| Romney Addresses the NAALCP \n \n RUSH: Romney showed up today at the NAALCP convention, and Snerdley came in here, “Oh, yeah, he did great. He was great.” And Karen Finney, this real locoweed commentator over at MSNBC, “Well, you gotta give Romney credit for showing up, for being willing to go.” Is that right? We’ve gotten to the point where he gets credit for going? I mean say what you want about the NAALCP, they’re still human beings, they’re Americans. Credit for going? Every presidential candidate goes to the NAALCP. McCain went, didn’t he? Bush went, didn’t he? Name for me one that didn’t. (interruption) Oh, Obama hasn’t gone? (laughing) \n \n At any rate, here’s what Karen Finney said, “It’s more about your actions than it is about what you say.” That’s a crock. Not with that group. It’s totally about what you say. Obama has devastated the black community in this country economically, literally devastated them. It’s totally what you say. Not your actions. But remind me again here, folks, ’cause before Romney showed up at the NAALCP, we had Fox on, and Alan Colmes was on there… I was gonna say something, but I’m gonna dial it back. Alan Colmes was saying that Romney doesn’t care about people. He doesn’t care about the poor. He doesn’t care about black people. He doesn’t care. He’s totally out of touch. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t care about people in poverty. He doesn’t care about people that are suffering and hurting. He doesn’t care. \n \n Now, remind me again, why is being successful as a direct result of your own hard work and education, a negative? Why is being successful tantamount to being out of touch? In this country, in the American media, the American left, being successful is out of touch. And that’s a problem. Being successful is out of touch? Being successful means you don’t know what people are going through. Being successful means you don’t know about suffering? Being successful means you don’t know about the unsuccessful? Look, FDR and the Kennedys were hereditary millionaires, lucky sperm club. They just had to grow up. John Kerry, the haughty John Kerry, who served in Vietnam, married into his fortune. It’s his wife that owns the houses. His wife even owns his windsurfing board. He doesn’t even have enough money to buy that. His wife probably owns the Spandex that he wears when he’s out on the windsurfing board. \n \n The Kennedys, FDR, grew into it, lucky sperm club. Romney, however, is out of touch and doesn’t care. Why? ‘Cause he worked in the private sector, because he played by the rules, because he’s got some bank accounts in the Cayman Islands. Well, so does Debbie “Blabbermouth” Schultz, as it turns out. In fact, even the US government has foreign investment in all of these places where Romney supposedly has money. Romney helped grow small businesses. Romney helped grow companies. He built ’em into powerhouses. They ended up hiring a lot of people. He risked his own money. Looks like he raised a pretty wonderful family. Found time to rescue the winter Olympics from financial ruin. And he doesn’t care about people and he doesn’t know about suffering, and if he ever learned about suffering, he wouldn’t care about it. \n \n How convoluted are these people? How is what Romney has done out of touch? And John Kerry and the Kennedys and FDR, why, they know everything. They’re the biggest hearts, big compassion. It seems to me that Romney has been a hands-on leader. I realize we’ve taken a lot of calls in the past on the program, when I talk about Romney in a positive way, a lot of you people get mad. I can’t help it. I mean, the facts are the facts. Romney has many and varied successes. They’ve been a direct result of being hands-on. He has worked and he’s worked very hard. And yet he’s out of touch. \n \n \n \n Now, Romney spoke at the NAALCP. Does anybody know if they required a photo ID to get in to Romney’s speech? ‘Cause Eric Holder went to the NAALCP yesterday. They required a photo ID. I am not kidding. (interruption) You didn’t know that? They required a photo ID at the NAALCP yesterday to get in to see Eric Holder, while he’s making a speech promising the members of the NAALCP that there will not be photo IDs to vote in Texas. It ain’t gonna happen. ‘Cause it’s a poll tax, ain’t gonna happen. But they required a photo ID to get in to see Eric Holder. I wonder if Holder brought the New Black Panther Party along with him, put ’em outside the venue and checked the photo IDs of the media as they were coming in. \n \n Let’s listen to a little bit of Romney at the NAALCP, because Snerdley came in, thought he did great. I’ll play the sound bites and you tell me what you think. He got booed, but Snerdley thinks he deserves a lot of credit because even after he got booed he kept coming back and he didn’t buckle. So we have four little quick bites here. Here’s number one. Mitt Romney, NAALCP in Houston. \n \n ROMNEY: I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real enduring best interests of American African-American families, you would vote for me for president. Now, of course you know the opposition charges that I and people in my party are running for office to help the rich. Nonsense. The rich will do just fine, whether I’m elected or not. The president wants to make this campaign about blaming the rich, and I want to make this a campaign about helping the middle class in America. (applause) \n \n RUSH: You can barely hear the applause. You can barely hear the applause. I watched a little bit of this and I felt like I was in a mortuary. I felt like I was in a funeral home watching this. Tepid applause talking about lifting the middle class. To heck with the rich. The rich are gonna be rich no matter who’s elected and the rich are gonna be fine no matter who’s here, which is true. You’ll hear later, Carville is out on Fox this morning, huge discussion on whether I was right in terms of the economy being a major factor in the campaign, as Romney’s using it. And after that discussion we’ve got some sound bites of Carville saying it’s no longer the economy. He’s not talking about me. He said class warfare is the new tactic that will work for Obama. That’s what he says. \n \n Carville and Greenberg, polling data, class warfare, that’s what’s gonna work. You know Carville and Greenberg want Obama to stay away from touting the economy. Stop talking about this economic recovery you got going, dude, there isn’t any. Nobody’s gonna buy it. Instead they want him now to start talking about class envy. (interruption) You snicker? Here is Romney talking about the rich are gonna be cool no matter what. That’s not what these people want to hear. These people want to hear, “I am gonna put the rich in jail.” He woulda gotten a standing O. “I’m gonna put the rich in jail, I’m gonna jail myself, and then I’m gonna give everything I take from myself and the rich to the middle class.” That woulda gotten a standing O with this group. Okay, here’s the next bite. \n \n ROMNEY: As you may have heard from my opponent, I’m also a believer in the free enterprise system. I believe it can bring change where so many well meaning government programs have failed. I’ve never heard anyone look around an impoverished neighborhood and say, “You know, there’s just too much free enterprise around here. Too many shops. Too many jobs. Too many people putting money in the bank.” What you hear, of course, is, “How do we bring in jobs? How do we make good, honest employers want to move in?” \n \n RUSH: No. \n \n ROMNEY: Stay in. \n \n RUSH: Not anymore. \n \n ROMNEY: And with the shape the economy’s in today, we’re asking that question more and more. \n \n RUSH: No, we’re not. \n \n ROMNEY: Free enterprise. Free enterprise is still the greatest force for upward mobility, economic security, and the expansion of the middle class. \n \n RUSH: Not to this group. That’s not what they want to hear. This group wants to hear about tax increases and bigger government to take care of people. They don’t want to hear about self-reliance; they don’t want to hear about free enterprise. Free enterprise means you’ve gotta do it yourself. Free enterprise means it’s up to you. Free enterprise means you’re on your own. This group doesn’t want to hear that. I don’t think Romney got a single vote in here today. \n \n I will tell you that he didn’t get a single vote. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if he gets a single vote outta here or not. Well, look, I’m not playing these sound bites to criticize Romney. That’s not my point here. The audience is gonna do that for me. The callers will criticize Romney for me. I am not trying to do that. (sigh) But, anyway, “I never heard anybody look around an impoverished neighborhood and say, ‘You know, there’s just too much free enterprise here.'” \n \n They do! \n \n The shop owners, the business owners are guilty to this group! \n \n It’s unfair they should own a business that charges a profit. (interruption) Well, you can smirk all you want. It’s where we are in our culture today. They do see too many businesses; they do see too many successful people. Those people have somehow cheated, lied, and stolen from other people to get what they’ve got — and then they’re earning a profit. Walmart’s an enemy, for crying out loud! They ought to be giving it all away, and then those people ought to be in jail after Romney puts the rich in jail. (interruption) \n \n Who do I think shops at Walmart? \n \n \n \n The NAALCP thinks it ought to be free at Walmart — or at cost, at least, at Walmart. Look, in Romney’s time at Bain Capital, he helped save or start over 150 companies. Staples. Burger King. You think any of those companies ever hired a black person? Do you think they did? I wonder what woulda happened if Romney woulda told ’em that? Boos? Accuse him of racism, tokenism? What woulda happened? How come Romney doesn’t pick up a black accent when he goes in there and talks to the NAALCP? \n \n That’s what Obama does. Obama brings out the Selma twang when he heads in there to the NAALCP. And Hillary. (impression) “I ain’t no ways tiiiired.” Then they stand up and they give Hillary a cheer, and Obama says things like (impression), “Well, my grandfather came down here with the po’.” They scream, “Right on, dude!” And they stand up for a standing ovation! Romney goes in there today, and he sounded like Snow White with Testicles. That’s not what this bunch wants to hear. Here’s the next bite. \n \n ROMNEY: I’m gonna eliminate every nonessential expensive program I can find. That includes Obamacare, and I’m gonna work to reform and save — \n \n AUDIENCE: (boos and grumbling) \n \n RUSH: We didn’t edit that. That was 15 seconds of boos. That’s a short bite. What did Romney say? He said, “I’m gonna eliminate every nonessential expensive program I can, and that includes Obamacare, and I’m gonna work to reform…” Booooo! So what are these people telling us? They want to pay taxes higher than ever. They want to pay penalties if they don’t have health insurance. They want the health care system to deteriorate into something that’s worse than it could possibly be. \n \n That’s what these people are telling us they want. (interruption) Look… Okay, give ’em the benefit of the doubt. They don’t know what’s in it. They don’t care what’s in it. All they know is it’s Obama’s plan, and here comes Snow White with Testicles in there ripping it to shreds, and so they’re booing him. Is that it? (interruption) Okay. Well, somebody needs to tell ’em after they boo, “Oh, so you want to pay a penalty for not having health insurance? Oh, so you want your taxes to be higher than they’ve ever been just to have health insurance? Is that what you want?” \n \n Here’s the last Romney bite before the NAALCP today in Houston. \n \n ROMNEY: My agenda is not to put in place a series of policies that get me a lot of attention and applause. My policy will be, number one: Create jobs for the American people. I do not have a hidden agenda. \n \n AUDIENCE: (smattering of applause) \n \n ROMNEY: And I submit to you this. If you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him. \n \n AUDIENCE: (boos and applause) \n \n ROMNEY: You take a look. \n \n RUSH: Hey, Romney told ’em what they unemployment rate was in the black community. What is it, almost 14%? Yeah, it’s either 13.9% or 14%. It’s way high. He didn’t use a number, but he said black unemployment is higher than anybody else’s. It’s higher than Hispanic unemployment, higher than the general unemployment rate. Okay, it’s 14%. So he told ’em: Under Barack Obama, black unemployment is skyrocketing with no end in sight. He tells them that he’s gonna end it, and they boo! Now, by the way, this Snow White business, that’s not me. I’m projecting. I’m saying that’s how he’s viewed inside the NAALCP convention. Remember the context. Hillary goes in there (impression), “I ain’t no ways tiiiired. And Obama goes in and drops some Selma lingo on ’em. And Romney goes in there and sounds like white bread. That’s all I was saying. \n \n BREAK TRANSCRIPT \n \n RUSH: Okay, here you go. Here’s a tweet that went out from a Democrat operative on Twitter after Romney showed up at the NAALCP convention. Here’s the tweet: “Rich white man booed at NAACP for saying he wants to take away healthcare from 30M people and replace it with a $5M tax cut for himself.” To these people, that is what repealing Obamacare is. Repealing Obamacare, to the American left, is denying free health care to 30 million people while you give yourself a tax cut and hold onto your own health care. \n \n That’s what it is, and that’s what the Democrats are spreading. \n \n That’s what they say Romney wants to do: Take health care away from 30 million people. Now, I would love to see somebody poll the conventioneers at the NAALCP and find out how many of them realize that they’re not getting free health care under Obamacare. That, in fact, they’re gonna be fined for not buying health insurance. I wonder how many of them know. It’s anecdotal, and I have a lot of rich and powerful friends that owned and own businesses, and they told me. \n \n They have told me that many of their employees, after the Supreme Court decision, came up to them and said, “Is my health care free now?” I have no clue, I have no idea what the majority of Americans think, but I can tell you what the left thinks. The left thinks Obamacare is free health care for themselves and the 30 million who are uninsured. And they also believe that the people who want to repeal it don’t want people to have free health care. They don’t want people to have what they’ve got. That’s why they don’t like the poor. That’s why they don’t care about the poor. \n \n This is whole meme. It’s total BS, but this is what the Democrat Party is spreading. Now, what do I think Romney was really doing here in this speech today? I don’t think he was speaking to that audience. That’s why I kinda got a little short with Snerdley. I think Romney used the forum. He knew there’s media there. I think he used the forum to try to take the occasion here to spread his own message about the economy and everything else he’s trying to accomplish in his campaign. I think he used this event as an opportunity, rather than to speak to these people directly as his primary purpose. \n \n BREAK TRANSCRIPT \n \n RUSH: I kind of glossed over this in the early portion of the program. Do you find it interesting that, of the two presidential candidates, Romney is the one who went to the NAALCP? Obama’s not going. It’s not that he hasn’t been yet. I don’t think Obama’s going. Obama, he doesn’t want to go to the NAALCP precisely because the black unemployment rate’s 14%, precisely because, if the truth be known, they feel let down. If the truth be known, African-Americans, especially at the leadership levels like the NAALCP, think Obama has abandoned them. There hasn’t been one fulfillment of any dream they had. \n \n I want you to put yourself in their position, with what they think about life in this country since the founding, including slavery, all of that stuff, affirmative action, discrimination, left and right, you name it. First black president is elected. You know that they had dreams and aspirations. They thought a whole bunch of getting even with ’em out there was gonna be happening. They thought a whole bunch of wrongs were gonna be fixed. They thought — well, who knows specifically, but you know they had high expectations for Obama, and not one of them has been met. The people that wanted a new kitchen, don’t have it. The people that wanted a new car, don’t have it. The people that wanted jobs, don’t have it. And so Obama’s not showing up. Romney did. \n \n Romney knows, get 3% of the black vote and you throw this election into a tizzy. Get 5% of the black vote, and Obama loses. So he shows up today. Obama doesn’t show up anywhere, other than before an audience of college kids or union people. That’s it. You won’t see Obama at the NAALCP. He’s gonna send Biden, tell some sex jokes, or whatever else Biden’s gonna end up gaffing. But Obama’s getting nowhere near it. Now, Romney did and will. Romney will speak to venues like the NAALCP. He’ll go into enemy territory. Obama will not. And who’s the president of the United States and who’s the candidate? Obama’s the Preezy. Jimmy Fallon: “Obama’s the Preezy of the United States.” And he doesn’t dare show up. \n \n He’s confident they’ll boo Romney, simply ’cause Romney’s white. He’s confident of that. But he knows that he’s gonna have hell to pay in private meetings with these people. He’s not gonna get anywhere near it. So what an insult. Here’s Obama sending Biden, not going himself. On the campaign trail, talking about how great his economy is, how great the recovery is, how much better it’s gonna be, and how much he’s gonna be doing for people. So Romney takes advantage of the occasion. He goes there and makes a speech that is, really, I think over these people’s heads, in the sense that his audience was much larger than just inside the convention hall. He’s got the media there, and here’s an opportunity for Romney to be himself, tell everybody what he stands for, what he believes, what he wants to do, what his problems are. It doesn’t matter if he gets booed. \n \n By the way, he got a standing O at the end of it. After all of that he did get a standing ovation at the end of his speech at the NAALCP. I don’t know how many news media will report that. But I think it’s an insult to send Biden to the NAALCP, first black president, election year, can’t show up to your convention? Behind closed doors, I’m telling you, and this is Democrat cloakrooms all across the country, there’s panic, there’s fear, and they know that they are in trouble.",
    "summary": "– Mitt Romney got booed during his speech to the NAACP yesterday, but many observers on the left are saying that's just what he wanted, reports Politico. \"I think it was a calculated move on his part to get booed at the NAACP convention,\" said Nancy Pelosi.

But Rep.

Learn more ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - A majority of Americans say Democrat Hillary Clinton won Monday night’s presidential debate, but her performance doesn’t appear to have immediately boosted her support among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Wednesday. \n \n The online poll, which gathered responses from more than 2,000 people on Tuesday, found 56 percent of American adults felt that Clinton did a better job than Trump in the first of their three televised debates, compared with 26 percent who felt that Trump did better. \n \n Of those who thought Clinton emerged the victor, 85 percent were Democrats and 22 percent were Republicans. \n \n U.S. presidential debates have historically been seen as a crucial test of candidates’ poise and policies. Monday’s was watched by a record 84 million viewers and was billed as a rare prime-time opportunity for two unpopular candidates to convince millions of undecided voters to back them. \n \n Afterward, both candidates claimed victory. \n \n ““Every single online poll had me winning,” Trump said at a campaign stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa on Wednesday. “You sit back and you hear how well she did in the debate. I don’t think she did well at all.” \n \n Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the Democrat clearly won the debate as Trump “was unprepared, became unhinged and was incoherent throughout.” \n \n Among those who are expected to take part in the Nov. 8 general election, 34 percent said they felt that the debate changed their view of Clinton in a positive way, compared with 19 percent who said the same of Trump. \n \n DELAYED REACTION \n \n Some 31 percent of likely voters said the debate improved Clinton’s chances of winning the White House, while 16 percent said the debate benefited Trump. \n \n Even so, Clinton’s performance seemed to have little impact on her support among America’s likely voters. The poll showed 42 percent supported Clinton while 38 percent supported Trump. Over the past few weeks Clinton has maintained a lead of between 4 and 6 points over Trump. \n \n Narrowing the focus to likely voters who watched the debate, Clinton led Trump 44 percent to 39 percent. \n \n One possible reason for the lack of movement in her support is that it usually takes several days to measure the full impact of a single event, like a debate, said Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University. \n \n The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted every day in English in all 50 states. Monday’s sample of 2,036 American adults included 1,336 people who were considered to be likely voters from their voting record, registration status and stated intention to vote in the election. Among those likely voters, 1,026 said they watched some portion of the debate on live TV, online or in media clips that were circulated after the debate. \n \n Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks as Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listens during their first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, September 26, 2016. REUTERS/Pool \n \n The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and the sample of likely voters. It has a credibility interval of 4 percentage points for the likely voters who watched the debate. \n \n National opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for Clinton and Trump. Some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls. \n \n Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clinton’s lead over Trump has been shrinking this month to about 2 percentage points.",
    "summary": "– Donald Trump was pretty pleased with his performance against Hillary Clinton at Monday's debate, even though scientific polls—not the easily manipulated online polls that Trump is citing—show most Americans pick Clinton as the clear victor. Even some of his own campaign advisers don't feel he was on point enough during the head-to-head, though they're framing it as \"missed opportunities\" rather than total failure. And so the strategy for Oct. 9's debate is reportedly getting an overhaul, with more role-playing practice, facts study, and even rehearsing how to move around the stage for the town-hall-style event, per the New York Times. What these advisers, who spoke anonymously to the paper, are worried about, however, is whether Trump will agree to this prep. Complicating things: Some say he actually was drilled on how to combat Clinton on certain issues and that he just chose not to. Others point the finger at Trump's extremely busy schedule in the days before the debate and too many people (up to a dozen, some with not much political acumen) giving him conflicting suggestions. Sources say his debate training was \"unconventional,\" with Trump unable to concentrate during more traditional sessions and preferring to simply dish with advisers rather than have mock debates. Trump himself told Fox News he found it hard to segue into some of those challenges against Clinton on the debate stage, such as the subject of Benghazi. Trump's pulling back—he stopped attacking Clinton and even grew \"subdued\" as the debate proceeded—has got to change the next time around, frustrated aides say. Instead, he has to set Clinton's vulnerabilities in his sights and stick to his plan for the whole night. \"It clearly looked like he ran out of gas after 30 minutes [in the New York debate], and that came through loud and clear,\" a senior political strategist tells the Times."

    "document": "Even HBO's \"Silicon Valley\" has caught on. John P. Johnson/HBO \n \n I'm sitting in a San Francisco, counter-service restaurant waiting for my chopped salad, when a group of tall, white men wearing button-downs and fleece vests crowds around the cash register. \n \n My boyfriend, who works in venture capital, spots them and says they're VCs. \n \n \"Do you know them?\" \n \n \"No,\" he says. \"The fleece vests. It's a giveaway.\" \n \n It's true. The fleece vest, often in black and from outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia, has become the most quintessentially-VC item in an investor's wardrobe. \n \n No one seems to know how the fashion faux pas turned into a staple, and yet, the fleece vest is inescapable in Silicon Valley. \n \n For example, Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and a partner at Greylock (whose investment portfolio includes Airbnb, Facebook, Flickr, and Zynga), rocked a Patagonia Men's Better Sweater Fleece Vest in Harvest Moon Blue. It retails for $99 on the website. \n \n Drew Angerer/Getty \n \n Marc Benioff, who has led Salesforce to fund some of the largest private cloud software companies in the world, wore a Salesforce-branded black vest on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt earlier this year. \n \n Steve Jennings/Getty \n \n Angel investor Joanne Wilson, the \"Gotham Gal,\" invests across all industries, from food, to gyms, to real estate. She elevated the black fleece stereotype with this high-fashion, mixed-materials vest. \n \n Noam Galai/Getty \n \n Business Insider spoke with several venture capitalists for this story and could not track down what brought on the vest's popularity. But we have some theories. \n \n A practical reason why the vest might be so popular is, it gets chilly year-round in the Bay Area. \n \n This year, San Franciscans (reluctantly) enjoyed one of the mildest summers on record. The city saw only one 70-degree day in August, meteorologists tell The San Francisco Chronicle. \n \n As investors make trips up and down the Bay, meeting with entrepreneurs, sitting in on board meetings, and negotiating deals in eternal-spring weather, it helps to zip up. \n \n \"This is the Bay Area so layering is useful,\" Kim Milosevich, a marketing partner at Andreeseen Horowitz, tells Business Insider. \n \n Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most well-known firms in Silicon Valley, orders Patagonia vests embroidered with the company's name for events. They typically order enough supplies for guests and employees. \n \n \"Our swag is mainly created as a gift for guests of our events, so we want it to be high quality and something they'd like [or] find useful,\" Milosevich says. \n \n Jeff Berg, CEO and chairman of International Creative Management Ltd., and Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company, sport swag from the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference in 2014. Scott Olson/Getty \n \n Patagonia has another explanation. They just make darn good vests. \n \n \"I think one reason for the popularity is: Patagonia represents quality without being pretentious,\" Corey Simpson, a communications coordinator at Patagonia, says. \n \n A casual, slightly pilled fleece vest may help Silicon Valley's many millionaires and billionaires feel (or at least look) grounded. \n \n Patagonia would not disclose its corporate sales customers. But with a retail location in Palo Alto, Simpson says Patagonia fields a lot of questions about the trend — especially after its best-selling vest made a cameo in HBO's \"Silicon Valley.\" \n \n Donald \"Jared' Dunn, played by actor Zach Woods, is the lovable and eccentric head of business development at Pied Piper. Whether he's living it up at a launch party for the fictional capital firm Bachmanity or polling TechCrunch Disrupt attendees on how to pivot the company, he dons a soft, fleece vest in Supply Green from Patagonia. \n \n HBO \n \n The show's production designer, Richard Royon, told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2014 that before the show aired, his team spent months surveying Silicon Valley for aesthetic inspiration. They racked up hours at Google, Facebook, Zynga, Apple, and Dell. \n \n \"Patagonia was clearly very important,\" Toyon said. \"You walk around University Avenue and look at all the people wearing Patagonia during the day. It's kind of crazy.\" \n \n The vest trend even spans from Silicon Valley to New York City's Silicon Alley. \n \n Henry McNamara, a general partner at New York-based Greak Oaks Venture Capital, tells Business Insider he also owns a fleece vest. He's not sure why he sees so many in the wild. \n \n \"I guess I've never really thought about it,\" McNamara says. \"I just really like vests.\" \n \n Disclosure: The author is in a relationship with an employee of Andreessen Horowitz. ||||| The vest has become the unofficial uniform for Silicon Valley investors. HBO; Uniqlo; Melia Robinson/Business Insider \n \n San Francisco's airport has a vending machine that dispenses vests — the unofficial uniform for venture capital investors — and Twitter has been poking fun all week. \n \n But a spokesperson for the airport tells us that the machine's sales figures are no joke. \n \n The Uniqlo-branded vending machine earns $10,000 a month on average, according to Doug Yakel, a public information officer for San Francisco International Airport. \n \n At nearly $50 a pop, that means the vending machine sells about 200 vests per month. \n \n It's one of the highest-earning vending machines that its leasing tenant — a third-party company that also sells electronics and other consumer goods out of vending machines — operates at the airport, according to Yakel. It's unclear what cut SFO and Uniqlo take. \n \n \"This is the first time we've had clothing available for sale from a vending machine, which we thought was very unique,\" Yakel told Business Insider. \n \n Japanese retailer Uniqlo started selling clothes out of vending machines in airports and malls across the US last year. At the time, these so-called \"Uniqlo To Go\" machines stocked two of the most popular items from the brand's \"LifeWear\" collection: a thermal heat-tech T-shirt ($14.90) and a lightweight down jacket ($69.90) in an array of colors. \n \n It appears Uniqlo added down vests for the tech set at San Francisco's airport. The Men's Ultra Light Down Vest typically retails for $49.90 online and in the vending machine. \n \n \"SFO has a down vest vending machine for visiting VCs,\" said Frank Barbieri, a serial entrepreneur, in a now-viral tweet that included a photo of the vending machine. \n \n Venture capitalists can be seen sporting the practical outerwear wherever techies gather, from Blue Bottle Coffee shops to the Battery to the VC offices on Sand Hill Road. \n \n San Francisco has chilly summers, with temperatures hovering between the mid-50s and high-60s.

    "document": "When Ottawa researchers publish a paper about a protein that can used to treat heart disease on Tuesday, fellow scientists in California will probably be saying, “Doh!” like Homer Simpson. \n \n The naturally-occurring protein, called cardiotrophin 1, also known as CT-1, can trick the heart into repairing damage and improving blood flow. Therapy using the protein, which the Ottawa researchers have already proved in animal models, will likely be ready for clinical trials in patients with right heart failure and myocardial infarction — heart attack — in two or three years. \n \n With luck, therapy will be available to the general population in about a decade. It might even reduce the need for heart transplants. \n \n About 20 years ago, the California scientists were investigating CT-1 and benefits for heart patients, but they gave up after they learned that CT-1 was also linked to disease. Around 2005, the Ottawa researchers decided to tease out how the mechanisms behind how the protein worked, both positive and negative. They believed the negative effects were compensating for something else. \n \n The Ottawa researchers, including scientists from The Ottawa Hospital, the University of Ottawa, the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and Carleton University and private industry, have worked to understand the signalling pathways, genes and cellular processes associated with CT-1. It was a long road, and along the way there were a lot of blind alleys, said Lynn Megeney, the senior author on a paper published Tuesday in the journal Cell Research. \n \n When part of the heart dies, its remaining muscles try to adapt by getting bigger. But this happens in a dysfunctional way, and it doesn’t actually help the heart pump more blood. CT-1 helps the muscles to grow in a more healthy way and stimulates blood vessel growth around the heart, improving its ability to pump blood. \n \n This process happens naturally during pregnancy and when athletes exercise. After the baby is born or the athlete stops exercising, the heart returns to its original state, said Megeney, a senior scientist at The Ottawa Hospital and professor at the University of Ottawa. \n \n The researchers have tested CT-1 on animal models with right heart failure. In humans, more than 40 per cent of the total heart failure population has right heart failure, said Megeney. It’s a growing epidemic in North America and one of the leading causes of death and disability in high-income nations. \n \n “The medical world has become quite proficient at treating heart failure. It’s good at helping people with classic congestive heart failure. But the problem is that these medications don’t work on right heart failure.” \n \n For some patients, the only option is a heart transplant. \n \n CT-1 can “beneficially remodel” the right side of the heart, he said. While exercise could theoretically have the same benefits, people with heart failure usually can’t exercise. “Treatment with CT-1 might get them to that point.” \n \n In the research with mice and rats, CT-1 was delivered with a mini-pump about the size of a tablet inserted under the skin. A similar gadget would likely work with people. \n \n Treatment is not a permanent solution. So far, about two weeks of treatment have proven to be beneficial for about two months after treatment stops. The researchers still need to figure out the minimum dose to get the maximum effect, but CT-1 treatment could replace a cocktail of drugs, said Megeney. \n \n Dr. Duncan Stewart, a cardiologist, co-senior author of the paper and executive vice-president of research at The Ottawa Hospital, called the experimental therapy “very exciting”, especially since it shows promise for both right and left heart failure. Megeney and Stewart have patents pending for the use of CT-1 to treat heart conditions. \n \n “Currently, the only treatment for right heart failure is a transplant,” said Stewart. “And although we have drugs that can reduce the symptoms of left heart failure, we can’t fix the problem, and left heart failure often leads to right heart failure over time.” \n \n Score one for basic science. \n \n “This derives from simple, basic research on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make heart muscle grow,” said Megeney, who has already presented the findings at international meetings. “People hadn’t pushed to understand the process. It was under the radar for a long time.” ||||| A protein called cardiotrophin 1 might be an effective treatment for heart failure, according to researchers who found that it tricks the heart into growing in a healthy way. This growth is reversible, similar to that which occurs in response to endurance exercise or pregnancy. \n \n \n \n Researchers from Canada have shown that it may be possible to trick the heart into growing healthily, without having to exercise. Researchers from Canada have shown that it may be possible to trick the heart into growing healthily, without having to exercise. \n \n The team, including members from the Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa in Ontario, Canada, reports the finding in the journal Cell Research. \n \n The study paper also describes how, in animal models of heart failure, cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) promotes heart repair and improves blood flow. \n \n Heart failure is a serious condition in which the heart cannot pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of the body and its organs. The condition commonly results from heart muscle damage following a heart attack, the main cause of which is coronary artery disease. \n \n There are around 26 million people living with heart failure worldwide, and numbers are rising. \n \n Step forward in regenerative medicine \n \n The outlook for patients diagnosed with heart failure are poor; their survival rates are worse than those of patients with breast, prostate, and bowel cancer. \n \n In the United States - where around 5.7 million adults are living with heart failure - around half of patients die within 5 years of being diagnosed. \n \n If heart failure is diagnosed and treated early, it is possible to improve survival and quality of life. Treatment usually consists of drug therapy, reducing dietary sodium, and exercising regularly. \n \n The new study represents a step forward in a regenerative medicine approach to the treatment of heart failure, where the aim is to treat or even cure the disease by regrowing damaged tissue or restoring function. \n \n Co-senior study author Lynn Megeney, a professor at the University of Ottawa, explains that when part of the heart dies - as it does in heart failure - \"the remaining muscles try to adapt by getting bigger, but this happens in a dysfunctional way and it doesn't actually help the heart pump more blood.\" \n \n But he says that, in animals with heart failure, they found that CT1 caused the heart muscles to \"grow in a more healthy way,\" and it also stimulated the heart to grow new blood vessels. \"This actually increases the heart's ability to pump blood, just like what you would see with exercise and pregnancy,\" he adds. \n \n CT1 investigated in several models \n \n Prof. Megeney and team investigated the effects of CT1 in laboratory-grown heart muscle cells, rats, and mice. They also compared the effects of CT1 with those of phenylephrine (PE), which is a drug that stimulates the \"bad kind of heart growth,\" such as the harmful, irreversible enlargement that occurs in heart failure. \n \n The researchers found that, when treated with CT1, heart muscle cells grow into longer, healthier fibers, whereas treatment with PE just results in wider growth. Also, with CT1, the new heart muscle tissue formed with new blood vessels alongside, which helps the heart to pump better. PE did not have this effect. \n \n Furthermore, the heart growth that occurs with CT1 is reversible; when treatment stops, the organ returns to its original size, as it does when exercise stops or after pregnancy. The unhealthy heart growth that results from PE, on the other hand, is irreversible; when treatment stops, the heart remains dysfunctionally enlarged. \n \n In two animal models of heart failure - one caused by heart attack, which damages the left side of the heart, and the other caused by pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the lungs, which damages the right side - CT1 treatment led to \"dramatic improvements\" in heart function. \n \n Finally, although both CT1 and PE use the \"cell suicide,\" or apotosis, molecular pathway to trigger heart muscle growth, CT1 showed superior ability to control the pathway. \n \n The team is excited by these findings because, if they translate to humans, they could vastly improve the prognosis for patients with heart failure. \n \n Promising for both types of heart failure \n \n Co-senior author Prof. Duncan Stewart - cardiologist, senior scientist, and executive vice president of research at the Ottawa Hospital - explains that, at present, the \"only treatment for right heart failure is a transplant.\" \n \n \"And although we have drugs that can reduce the symptoms of left heart failure,\" he adds, \"we can't fix the problem, and left heart failure often leads to right heart failure over time.\" \n \n The researchers are hopeful that CT1 will work in humans with heart failure because it did so in several animal models of the condition. \n \n They also point out that, while in theory, exercise is an obvious way to reap the benefits that CT1 appears to offer, this route is not open to people with heart failure, who can only exercise in a limited way. \n \n Profs. Megeney and Stewart already have patents pending for using CT1 to treat heart problems, and they hope to partner with others to test the protein in human patients. \n \n Nevertheless, they say that it will be several years, even if the tests are successful, before the treatment is ready for widespread clinical use. ||||| Researchers have discovered that a protein called cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) can trick the heart into growing in a healthy way and pumping more blood, just as it does in response to exercise and pregnancy. They show that this good kind of heart growth is very different from the harmful enlargement of the heart that occurs during heart failure. They also show that CT1 can repair heart damage and improve blood flow in animal models of heart failure. The results are published in Cell Research. The research team is from The Ottawa Hospital, the University of Ottawa, the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and Carleton University. \n \n Heart failure is a leading cause of death and disability in high-income countries and a growing problem around the world. It occurs when the heart can't pump enough blood through the body, often because a heart attack has damaged the heart muscle tissue. \n \n \"When part of the heart dies, the remaining muscles try to adapt by getting bigger, but this happens in a dysfunctional way and it doesn't actually help the heart pump more blood,\" said Dr. Lynn Megeney, senior author of the study and a senior scientist at The Ottawa Hospital and professor at the University of Ottawa. \"We found that CT1 causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart. This actually increases the heart's ability to pump blood, just like what you would see with exercise and pregnancy.\" \n \n Dr. Megeney and his colleagues conducted a variety of studies in mice, rats and cells growing in the lab. In addition to CT-1, some of the studies involved a drug called phenylephrine (PE), which is known to cause the bad kind of heart growth. They found: \n \n Heart muscle cells treated with CT-1 become longer, healthier fibres, while those treated with PE just grow wider. \n \n CT-1 causes blood vessels to grow alongside the new heart muscle tissue and increases the heart's ability to pump blood, while PE does neither. \n \n When CT-1 treatment stops, the heart goes back to its original condition, just like it does when exercise or pregnancy end. However, the dysfunctional heart growth caused by PE is irreversible. \n \n CT-1 dramatically improves heart function in two animal models of heart failure - one caused by a heart attack (affecting the left side of the heart) and one caused by high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension, affecting the right side of the heart). \n \n Both CT-1 and PE stimulate heart muscle growth through a molecular pathway that has traditionally been associated with promoting cell suicide (apoptosis), but CT-1 has a better ability to control this pathway. \n \n \"This experimental therapy is very exciting, particularly because it shows promise in treating both left and right heart failure,\" said Dr. Duncan Stewart, a cardiologist, senior scientist and co-senior author on the paper who is also Executive Vice-President of Research at The Ottawa Hospital and a professor at the University of Ottawa. \"Currently, the only treatment for right heart failure is a transplant. And although we have drugs that can reduce the symptoms of left heart failure, we can't fix the problem, and left heart failure often leads to right heart failure over time.\" \n \n \"An intriguing aspect of this research was how human CT1 was able to promote a healthy growth response in multiple animal models,\" said co-author Dr. Patrick Burgon, scientist at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. \"This suggests the action of CT1 is universally conserved and puts us much closer to therapy.\" \n \n The researchers also note that while exercise could theoretically have the same benefits as CT-1, people with heart failure are usually limited in their ability to exercise. \n \n Dr. Megeney and Dr. Stewart have patents pending for the use of CT-1 to treat heart conditions and they hope to develop partnerships to test this protein in patients. If this testing is successful it will take a number of years for the treatment to become widely available. \n \n ### \n \n Full reference: Cardiotrophin 1 Stimulates Beneficial Myogenic and Vascular Remodeling of the Heart.

    "summary": "– Scientists in Canada say they've found a way to trick the heart, making it behave as if it were the beneficiary of exercise even if no exercise was able to be done. According to a study in Cell Research, the Ottawa researchers discovered that protein cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) can fuel healthy heart growth, repair heart damage, and cause the heart to pump more blood in cases of left heart failure, as a result of heart attack, and right heart failure, as a result of high blood pressure in the lungs, reports Medical News Today. It's a big deal since medications used to treat left heart failure don't work on right heart failure, which usually requires a heart transplant, per a release. Exercise can be beneficial because it boosts the heart's ability to pump blood, but \"people with heart failure usually can't exercise,\" researcher Lynn Megeney tells the Ottawa Citizen. The heart usually responds by expanding, irreversibly, in an unhealthy way. But that's why CT1 is \"very exciting,\" Megeney says. It \"causes heart muscles to grow in a more healthy way and it also stimulates blood vessel growth in the heart,\" increasing blood flow just like with exercise. And just like with exercise, the heart returns to its original size afterward. Megeney says the discovery could lead to fewer heart transplants, but he says it could be two or three years before researchers begin clinical trials on humans and, assuming they go well, a decade before treatment is available to the public.

    "document": "The campaign gods are smiling down on Ted Cruz, gifting him a feud with conservatives’ most despised news outlet at a time when most 2016 campaigns are gasping for Trump-free air. \n \n At issue: The New York Times refuses to grant the Texas senator’s memoir, “A Time for Truth,” a place on its powerful list of bestselling books, despite his publisher’s insistence that his numbers should vault him well ahead of other titles in the top 10. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n News of Cruz’s exclusion broke this week after HarperCollins, the book’s publisher, sent a letter to the Times inquiring about its omission from the list, sources with knowledge of the situation told POLITICO, which first reported the story. The Times responded by telling HarperCollins that the book did not meet their criteria for inclusion. \n \n On Thursday, a Times spokesperson said that the book was excluded because the paper had found its sales to be mostly “strategic bulk purchases” — a common practice among political authors, but a claim hotly disputed by Cruz’s campaign. \n \n “The Times is presumably embarrassed by having their obvious partisan bias called out. But their response — alleging ‘strategic bulk purchases’ — is a blatant falsehood,” Cruz campaign spokesperson Rick Tyler said in a statement Friday. “The evidence is directly to the contrary. In leveling this false charge, the Times has tried to impugn the integrity of Senator Cruz and of his publisher Harper Collins.” \n \n “We call on the Times, release your so-called ‘evidence.’ Demonstrate that your charge isn’t simply a naked fabrication, designed to cover up your own partisan agenda,” Tyler continued. “And, if you cannot do so, then issue a public apology to Senator Cruz and Harper Collins editor Adam Bellow for making false charges against them.” \n \n Tyler’s blast came just minutes after HarperCollins announced it had found “no evidence of bulk orders or sales through any retailer or organization” — a statement that all but accused the Times of lying. The publisher also pointed out that ‘A Time For Truth’ “ranked high on other publishing industry bestseller lists including Nielsen Bookscan (#4) … The Wall Street Journal (#4) and Barnes and Noble (#7),” all of which “omit bulk orders books from their rankings.” \n \n Cruz’s camp is clearly relishing the controversy, which has been good for business. \n \n “It’s been a good week and a half with wall-to-wall coverage of the book, and yes, this latest unfortunate news courtesy of the New York Times is a chance to get yet more attention and drive readers to Senator Cruz’s book,” said Keith Urbahn, co-founder of Javelin, a D.C.-based literary agency and communications firm that represented Cruz on the deal and helped with his book rollout. “This controversy is already helping sales.” \n \n Several Cruz-linked Twitter accounts, including @TedCruz, also retweeted a Washington Post blog post with the headline, “Ted Cruz hits the jackpot: A book war with the New York Times.” \n \n Cruz is somewhat better positioned than many of his fellow 2016 rivals, who have struggled to get attention since real estate mogul Donald Trump entered the race. \n \n Not Cruz. Not only is his book a success, giving him a second round of publicity after his May 23 launch, he also appears to be having little trouble raising funds. His campaign announced this week that he had raised at least $51 million split between the official campaign and four super PACs, putting him in second place in the money race behind former Florida governor Jeb Bush and well ahead of Marco Rubio and Scott Walker. \n \n In that sense, Cruz’s feud with the Times is a happy bonus. \n \n Eileen Murphy, the Times spokesperson, said Friday that the paper was standing by her initial claim that the “overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales [of Cruz’s book] were limited to strategic bulk purchases.” Murphy did not respond to a request for comment regarding the Cruz campaign’s statement. \n \n In her initial response, Murphy said the Times had “uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold.” She later added, “Our goal is that the list reflect authentic best sellers, so we look at and analyze not just numbers, but patterns of sales for every book.” \n \n The Cruz campaign called Murphy’s initial explanation “cryptic,” and her later claims about bulk purchases “false.” \n \n “Their decision to blackball Cruz’s book suggests that the Times very much does not want people to read the book,” the campaign said. “There were no ‘strategic bulk purchases.’ Cruz spent last week on a nationwide book tour, signing copies of his book at multiple locations. Booksellers at each event had long lines — sometimes over 400 people per event.” \n \n “A Time For Truth” was published on June 30 and sold 11,854 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen Bookscan’s hardcover sale numbers. That’s more than 18 of the 20 titles that will appear on the bestseller list for the week ending July 4, including Aziz Ansari’s “Modern Romance,” which is #2 on the list, and Ann Coulter’s “Adios America,” which is #11. \n \n Cruz’s memoir has also sold more copies in a single week than Rand Paul’s “Taking a Stand,” which has been out for more than a month, and more than Marco Rubio’s “American Dreams,” which has been out for six months. \n \n That may partly be the result of much more aggressive promotion, and partly because Cruz’s book is simply more interesting, with revealing anecdotes about his half-sister’s drug overdose, his time looking at pornography while clerking on the Supreme Court, and his blistering attacks on his fellow Republicans. \n \n “What will really make this book a long-term success is that Senator Cruz deliberately decided not to craft a boilerplate book of safe bromides, like most politicians do,” Urbahn said. \n \n A public brawl with The New York Times won’t hurt, either. As the Post’s Philip Bump noted, “When Costco axed Dinesh D’Souza’s book from its shelves last summer for poor sales, the resulting outcry ensured so much demand that Costco quickly restocked it.” \n \n “It’s important to look at a book like a campaign, setting the groundwork early and then seizing opportunities,” noted Urbahn. “The New York Times, ironically, offered us exactly that.” ||||| \n \n Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \n \n Perhaps the only thing better for Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 candidacy than seeing his book on the New York Times bestseller list is seeing the New York Times refuse to include it. \n \n Politico reported Thursday night that Cruz's (R-Tex.) new book, \"A Time for Truth,\" would be left off of the paper's bestsellers list. It does appear on the Publisher's Weekly list for the week, identifying that 11,853 copies were sold, landing it in fourth place between books from former Playboy bunny Holly Madison and enthusiastic facial-expression-maker Aziz Ansari. \n \n At first, the reason that Cruz wasn't being included weren't clear. A spokesperson for the Times simply told Politico that the paper has \"uniform standards that we apply to our best seller list, which includes an analysis of book sales that goes beyond simply the number of books sold. This book didn't meet that standard this week.\" \n \n Eventually, though, the Times told Politico that \"the overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales were limited to strategic bulk purchases\" -- in other words, someone bought a lot of copies of the book so that Cruz would make it onto the bestseller list. Or, to put it more bluntly: Someone gamed the system. \n \n Cruz's publisher denies that. In a statement to Buzzfeed, HarperCollins said that it had \"investigated the sales pattern for Ted Cruz’s book\" and \"found no evidence of bulk orders or sales through any retailer or organization.\" It went on to note that Nielsen Bookscan excludes bulk sales from its figures, which resulted in the 11,800 number above. \n \n You will not be surprised to learn that the news of Cruz's omission was met with either gloating or fury directed at the liberal media, depending on observers' political leanings. \n \n For example: \n \n Update, 4:00 p.m.: Cruz joins the fight. In a statement to Politico, spokesman Rick Tyler said, \"The Times is presumably embarrassed by having their obvious partisan bias called out. But their response — alleging 'strategic bulk purchases' — is a blatant falsehood. The evidence is directly to the contrary. In leveling this false charge, the Times has tried to impugn the integrity of Senator Cruz and of his publisher Harper Collins.\" \n \n If you're curious, that 11,800 in sales is substantially lower than the 86,000 first-week sales of Hillary Clinton's \"Hard Choices\" -- though that was backed up with a healthy public relations blitz. (It's closer to Clinton's fourth week, when she sold 17,000 copies.) It's also lower than the sales of Mitt Romney's 2012 book, \"No Apology,\" which did 42,000 in sales in its first week. \n \n Here is a prediction! The Times will soon include Cruz's book on its list, in part because the negative (or, depending on how you look at it, positive) publicity will help goose sales. When Costco axed Dinesh D'Souza's book from its shelves last summer for poor sales, the resulting outcry ensured so much demand that Costco quickly restocked it. \n \n In which case Cruz gets the conservative cred of being blackballed by the Times and the PR bonus of being a Times bestseller. Win-win.",
    "summary": "– So Ted Cruz's book won't be listed among the New York Times' best sellers, even though it racked up about 12,000 sales in its first week. But if you think Cruz is angry, you've got it exactly backward, reports Politico. The feud is a sign that the \"campaign gods are smiling down\" on him, writes Dylan Byers. It's helping him among conservatives who loathe the paper as too liberal, and it's generating more attention for his book. If you missed the original controversy, the Times essentially accused the Cruz campaign of rigging the system by buying up books in bulk. But publisher HarperCollins disputes that, as does the campaign. “The Times is presumably embarrassed by having their obvious partisan bias called out,\" says spokesman Rick Tyler. \"But their response—alleging ‘strategic bulk purchases’—is a blatant falsehood.\" Tyler challenged the newspaper to present its evidence for the accusation. In a piece at the Washington Post headlined \"Ted Cruz hits the jackpot: A book war with the New York Times,\" Philip Bump predicts an ironic conclusion to the tale: The book will eventually show up on the Times' list because all this attention will do wonders for authentic, no-doubt-about-it sales. \"In which case Cruz gets the conservative cred of being blackballed by the Times and the PR bonus of being a Times bestseller.

    "document": "Story highlights The State Department issues a global travel alert on possible al Qaeda attacks \n \n Sources say al Qaeda is in final planning stages of unspecified plot \n \n Rep. King: Information is \"specific,\" attacks \"really could be almost anyplace\" \n \n Western targets, not just American ones, are under threat, officials say \n \n A global travel alert issued Friday by the State Department warned al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East, North Africa and beyond in coming weeks, a threat that prompted Sunday's closure of 21 embassies and consulates. \n \n The U.S. government's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East as well as North Africa, said U.S. officials who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified. \n \n \"The threat appears to be much worse than it has (been) in a long time,\" said a senior national security official in Yemen, where the government is \"on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come.\" \n \n Various Western targets -- not just those tied to the United States -- are under threat, according to two U.S. officials. \n \n According to three sources, the United States has information that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula members are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. \n \n One of the sources said that such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. In particular, Sunday is Laylet al-Qadr, or the Night of Power, which is one of the holiest moments on the Muslim calendar. \n \n Said one U.S. official: \"It all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future.\" \n \n Based on intelligence, U.S. officials said, there was particular concern about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday. President Barack Obama -- who, amid regular updates on the situation, has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect Americans -- praised Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi for his country's efforts following a meeting Thursday at the White House. \n \n Still, it's unclear whether the apparent plot targets that Arabian nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly, and why embassies from Bangladesh to Libya are being closed. The expected time of an attack also isn't known, with the U.S. travel alert noting the threat extends through the end of August. \n \n Photos: Photos: Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi Photos: Photos: Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi – Attackers set the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012.

Moreover, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is one of the terrorist network's most active and most destructive branches. \n \n \"We have to remember that we're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women, children, diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets,\" Mattis told CNN on Friday. \"They are showing some proactive discretion here, making certain that we don't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them.\" \n \n Questions, concerns after Benghazi \n \n House leaders have been briefed on the situation, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided \"some understanding of the seriousness of the threat.\" \n \n King, who has also heard such briefings, applauded the government's decision to close its diplomatic missions. \n \n \"I give them credit,\" the Republican said of the Obama administration. \"I think the government is doing exactly the right thing here.\" \n \n Such bipartisan agreement in Washington come at a time politicians are still pushing to seek answers regarding the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consular compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. \n \n Since then, Republicans have been pressing President Barack Obama's administration for answers, with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in Benghazi and not doing enough to track down the attackers. \n \n Eight GOP lawmakers are asking that incoming FBI Director James Comey brief Congress within 30 days about the investigation.

    "document": "Families of victims in the Sandy Hook school shooting are taking their fight against a major gunmaker to the Connecticut Supreme Court on Tuesday. They're seeking to reinstate a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the military-style weapon used in the attack. \n \n Last year, a lawsuit filed by some victims' families was dismissed because federal law protects gunmakers from liability in shooting deaths, reports CBS News correspondent Don Dahler. \n \n Now, lawyers claim gun manufacturer Remington knowingly marketed its version of the AR-15 assault rifle to a high-risk group of young men, including shooter Adam Lanza. \n \n In a brief submitted to the Connecticut Supreme Court, attorneys representing 10 Sandy Hook families contend that in order to boost sales, gun manufacturer Remington targeted a \"younger demographic\" by \"linking the AR-15 to macho vigilantism and military-style insurrection.\" \n \n Nearly five years after her six-year-old son Dylan was killed by Lanza -- armed with an AR-15-style rifle made by Remington subsidiary Bushmaster -- Nicole Hockley wants the gun manufacturer held accountable. \n \n CBS News \n \n \"This is a weapon that's been designed to inflict mass casualties and, 'you're not a man if you don't have it.' That's morally reprehensible and, from a marketing perspective, that's just wrong and needs to stop,\" Hockley said. \n \n In print ads, the firearm is portrayed alongside phrases like: \"perform under pressure,\" \"bow down\" and \"consider your man card reissued.\" \n \n \"Remington increases the risk when they market the weapon this way, pulling in dangerous users,\" said Josh Koskoff, the attorney representing the 10 families in the suit against Remington. \n \n \"Not all of them are going to use them like Adam Lanza, but collectively, they're going to be at increased risk,\" Koskoff said. \n \n According to the Gun Violence Archive project, more than 1,500 mass shootings have taken place since Sandy Hook. \n \n Legal analysts say the effort to appeal the dismissed lawsuit rests on proving that the manufacturer's negligence allowed the weapon to fall into the wrong hands. \n \n \"What the appellate judges are supposed to do is judge this case according to the law. So although these horrific, horrific shootings that have happened are out there, theoretically the judges should disregard them,\" said CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman. \n \n CBS News reached out to Remington, but the gun manufacturer did not respond. If Tuesday's appeal is successful, the case will advance to the discovery phase, during which Remington's marketing campaigns could be scrutinized. ||||| HARTFORD, Conn. (Reuters) - A lawyer for families who lost loved ones in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting told Connecticut’s highest court on Tuesday that Remington Outdoor Co [FREDM.UL] should be held responsible because its military-themed marketing was designed to appeal to young men like killer Adam Lanza. \n \n “They knew they were hitting their mark and Lanza was responding to their marketing,” said lawyer Joshua Koskoff \n \n Lanza, 20, used a Remington AR-15 Bushmaster rifle, a semi-automatic civilian version of the U.S. military’s M-16, to kill 20 school children between the ages of 6 and 7, as well as six adult staff members, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012. He then killed himself. \n \n Following the conclusion Tuesday’s arguments, the Connecticut Supreme Court will now decide whether the families of nine of the victims and one survivor can proceed with a trial seeking to hold Remington, along with a gun wholesaler and local retailer, responsible for the carnage based on its marketing. \n \n A representative for the court declined to say when it would rule. \n \n The families are advancing a somewhat novel legal argument in hopes of overcoming a federal law enacted by U.S. Congress in 2005 to shield gun manufacturers from liability for how their products are used. \n \n Remington’s lawyer, James Vogts, told the Connecticut court that the families’ claims, first filed in 2014, are barred by the 2005 law. \n \n FILE PHOTO: Street artist Mark Panzarino, 41, prepares a memorial as he writes the names of the Sandy Hook Elementary School victims during the six-month anniversary of the massacre, at Union Square in New York, June 14, 2013. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo \n \n “What happened in the school that morning was horrific,” Vogts said. “But no matter how much we wished those children and teachers were still alive, the law needs to be applied.” \n \n A lower court judge agreed with the gun maker and dismissed the families’ lawsuit in 2016. But the Connecticut Supreme Court agreed to hear the case a week after the families filed their first appeal. \n \n The packed courtroom in Hartford, Connecticut, included many of the victims’ family members. Ian Hockley, who lost his 6-year-old son, Dylan, in the shooting, told reporters after the proceeding that families were “running out of patience” over the gun maker’s ability to escape liability. \n \n “But we have not lost one ounce of confidence in the validity of our case,” he said. \n \n The families claim Remington and the other defendants “extolled the militaristic and assaultive qualities” of the AR-15, advertising the rifle as “mission-adaptable” and “the ultimate combat weapons system” in a deliberate pitch to a demographic of young men fascinated by the military. \n \n The families said Lanza was part of that demographic and cited media reports saying he previously expressed a desire to join the army. The rifle was bought by Lanza’s mother, whom he also killed, as a gift for him or for the two of them to share, the lawsuit claims. \n \n The families’ argument is based on the legal doctrine of negligent entrustment, in which a product is carelessly sold or given to a person at high risk of using it in a harmful way. Negligent entrustment is specifically excepted from the 2005 gun maker shield laws. \n \n FILE PHOTO: Mourners hold signs during a solidarity vigil in memory of victims of Las Vegas' Route 91 Harvest music festival mass killing, in Newtown, Connecticut U.S., the site of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, October 4, 2017. REUTERS/Michelle McLoughlin/File Photo \n \n The argument has historically been used where someone lends a car to a high-risk driver who goes on to cause an accident. It has met with some success in lawsuits against gun shop owners, but legal experts said it has never been used before to target a manufacturer. \n \n David Studdert, a Stanford law professor, said on Monday he thought negligent entrustment was a tough argument for the families to make because it has traditionally involved someone having direct knowledge that another person poses a risk. \n \n If the Sandy Hook families are successful, Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University, said on Monday he would expect the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. ||||| Connecticut Supreme Court justices spent more than 90 minutes Tuesday peppering attorneys for some victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and the manufacturer of the gun used by the shooter with questions about the merits of a lawsuit filed by the families seeking to hold Remington Outdoor Co. liable for Adam Lanza’s shooting spree. \n \n In front of a packed courtroom that included about a half dozen victims’ families, lawyers representing special interest groups including the National Rifle Association and a group of physicians who have treated the victims of mass shootings, and national media, the five justices focused their questions on “negligent entrustment,” 100-year-old Connecticut laws and how a case about a slingshot injury in Michigan equates to one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history. \n \n It was difficult to ascertain any pattern in the justices’ questions. At one point, Justice Richard Palmer asked Remington attorney James Vogts what legitimate uses there were for an AR-15, noting that plaintiffs called the weapon used in the Newtown school shooting a “killing machine.” Vogts said it is used for target practice, deer hunting and home security. \n \n Justice Raheem L. Mullins asked plaintiffs’ attorney Josh Koskoff what could be a key legal question: “Was it negligent entrustment to sell the weapon to [Adam Lanza’s mother, Nancy Lanza]?” Nancy Lanza bought the Bushmaster AR-15 used in the shooting. \n \n A Superior Court judge in Bridgeport dismissed the lawsuit in 2016 agreeing with attorneys for Remington that the lawsuit \"falls squarely within the broad immunity\" provided to gun manufacturers and dealers by the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA. The lawsuit also named Camfour Holding LLP, the gun's distributor, and Riverview Gun Sales Inc., the East Windsor gun shop where Nancy Lanza purchased the AR-15 right around her son’s 18th birthday. \n \n Legal experts said the case will come down to how the state Supreme Court will interpret two possible exceptions allowed under PLCAA — whether Remington can be held liable for so-called “negligent entrustment” or whether it violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. Negligent entrustment is defined as “supplying of a qualified product by a seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or reasonably should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or others.” \n \n Koskoff started his argument taking the courtroom back to the morning of Dec. 14, 2012 to a “young man on a mission” who knew exactly what weapon to choose to carry out the killings — a Bushmaster assault weapon. \n \n “Remington may have never known Adam Lanza but they had been courting him for years,” Koskoff said. “It wasn’t just that [Remington] marketed the weapon looking for people with characteristics of Adam Lanza but that Adam Lanza heard the message. He idolized the military and wanted to be an Army Ranger and Remington marketed the AR-15 as the weapon used by the Army Rangers.” \n \n Adam Lanza killed 26 people, including 20 first graders, after shooting his way through the front window of the school before killing himself. Lanza had killed his mother before going to the school. Families of nine victims who were killed and a teacher who survived the Dec. 14, 2012 massacre filed the lawsuit in January 2015 seeking to hold Remington liable, arguing it marketed the AR-15 to the public even though it knew the weapon was designed for military use. \n \n Koskoff appealed the lower court’s dismissal and is seeking to have the high court return the case to the Bridgeport Superior Court so “the discovery phase of this case can begin and we can start uncovering documents on how this military weapon ended up in civilian hands.” The case has drawn national attention and came on the same day as a shooting at a school California and on the heels of another mass shooting inside a church two weeks ago in Texas. That was the fourth mass shooting involving assault weapons that has occurred since the Sandy Hook lawsuit was filed. \n \n There were five justices seated for the hearing. Two justices, newly appointed Maria Araujo Kahn and Richard A. Robinson, weren’t present for the hearing but will be involved in the court’s decision. Supreme Court hearings normally last an hour but justices had so many questions for Koskoff that Palmer extended the hearing to allow equal time for Vogts and a rebuttal by Koskoff. \n \n Vogts and attorney Christopher Renzulli, who represents Camfour, stuck to the argument that they have used since the lawsuit was filed — PLCAA protects them from this type of lawsuit. Vogts argued the law is clear — the manufacturer of the gun used at Sandy Hook is not liable for the damage “the criminal” caused. \n \n “There is no need for a legal re-examination of the law,” Vogts said. “Under the law, the manufacturer of the gun used by the criminal that day isn’t responsible legally for his actions.” \n \n Palmer challenged Vogts, asking him if he would acknowledge that the law must adapt to current times. \n \n “We’re not just hearing from plaintiffs the law needs to adapt,” Vogts said. “We’re hearing that the law of negligent entrustment needs to be ignored.” \n \n Vogts said courts in Connecticut and around the country have ruled that manufacturers are not held liable in cases such as Sandy Hook, but that the liability could rest with the gun seller, who can assess how appropriate it was to sell the weapon to the buyer. \n \n Justice Andrew McDonald then asked why Remington’s advertising boasts about how “forces of opposition bow down” to owners of the AR-15. “What purpose is that kind of advertising?” McDonald said. \n \n “The plaintiffs haven’t explained how advertisements fit into the issue of negligent entrustment,” Vogts said. He argued, “there is no case law on advertising being declared a cause of death.” Vogts said to the extent that advertising has been at the center of legal cases, they have concerned misleading or deceptive advertising, such as the kind involved in tobacco cases. \n \n The justices pushed Koskoff on how he expects to hold Remington liable for what occurred after a legal gun sale was made to Nancy Lanza in 2010.",
    "summary": "– The families of nine Sandy Hook victims and one teacher who survived the deadly mass shooting presented their case to Connecticut Supreme Court justices Tuesday in their lawsuit against Remington, maker of the AR-15 weapon used by Adam Lanza to kill 20 children and six adults in 2012, the Hartford Courant reports. The victims' argument centers around the marketing campaign behind the AR-15, which the mother of one 6-year-old victim tells CBS News was \"morally reprehensible.\" The lawsuit claims Remington linked \"the AR-15 to macho vigilantism and military-style insurrection\" in order to target a \"younger demographic\" and increase sales. One AR-15 ad included the tagline \"consider your man card reissued.\" Another ad touted it as \"the ultimate combat weapons system,\" according to Reuters. Josh Koskoff, lawyer for the victims' families, compared it to \"the Ford Motor Company advertising a car that can run over people\" and said that kind of advertising attracts \"dangerous users,\" including Lanza. \"Adam Lanza heard their message,\" Koskoff told the justices Tuesday. \"He idolized the military and Remington advertised the AR-15 as the weapon used by Army Rangers.\" He says Remington \"knew exactly what they were doing\" with its marketing strategies. James Vogts, lawyer for Remington, says the company is protected by the 2005 Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that shields gun makers from liability in shootings. \"No matter how much we wished those children and teachers were still alive, the law needs to be applied,\" Vogts told justices. Following Tuesday's arguments, justices will decide whether the families' lawsuit can go to trial."

Leonardo DiCaprio made over $25 million for his performance, while Jonah Hill – who wanted to be in the movie so badly he agreed to work for the union minimum – only took home $60,000. This means Leo took home a paycheck 416 times larger than Jonah's. \n \n One Jennifer Makes A Lot More Than The Other \n \n Jennifer Lawrence and Jennifer Aniston are two of the most successful actresses in Hollywood, and certainly the two highest-paid Jennifers. However, Lawrence's appearances in The Hunger Games means she earns $20 million more than the former Friends star. Lawrence took home $35 million last year, while Aniston snagged $15. \n \n Endorsements Pay Crazy Amounts \n \n Movies can make you money, but product endorsements can make you buy-an-island rich. Aside from the $75 million from Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. took home $12 million from an HTC endorsement. Meanwhile, Jennifer Aniston reportedly makes as much on her endorsements from Aveeno and Smartwater as she does for starring in a major film. And, don't forget TV host Bethenny Frankel who landed a deal with Skinnygirl that earned her $100 million. \n \n We Now Understand Why Liam Neeson Will Be Making 'Taken' Sequels Forever \n \n People really love watching 62-year-old Liam Neeson kick vaguely-foreign looking people in the face.

To be a winner in the business market it also has to be a winner in the consumer market, something that wasn't the case a decade ago. \n \n As Microsoft's own presentation about the deal, announced on Monday, notes: \"With the consumerisation of IT user matter at both home and work... We cannot risk having Apple or Google foreclose app innovation, integration, distribution or economics.\" \n \n Nokia lashed itself to Microsoft's mast after losing out to iOS and Android in the smartphone market share stakes and with the limited success of the Lumia range so far enough to keep interest in Windows Phone alive, most analysts are seeing a certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition, even if they are split on what its biggest implications are. \n \n Forrester mobile analyst Charles Golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other Windows Phone licensees has left Microsoft with just Nokia as its standard bearer and added Microsoft now appears \"poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to Apple's\". \n \n But he said Microsoft's challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands — Windows, Nokia, Live, Surface, Xbox, Bing and more — into a cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty. \n \n \"That's a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board's choice of a new CEO,\" he said. \n \n Richard Holway, chairman of analyst TechMarketView, said given that Microsoft paid $8.5bn for Skype in 2011, the price it is paying for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable\". \n \n However, he added: \"Our only 'surprise' now is the timing of the announcement. For such a big deal to come just days after Ballmer stood down seems mighty strange.\" \n \n For Holway, there is also an opportunity for the enlarged Microsoft to step up its business mobility efforts: \"There is undoubtedly a market opportunity for the creation of a provider of mobile solutions for the enterprise. Taking Office onto various mobile platforms. Providing secure emailing in a sector once occupied by BlackBerry.\" \n \n But such a move carries its own risks — Microsoft's success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it. Already its move into the tablet market with Surface will have unsettled its manufacturers which have struggled to come up with convincing form factors to tackle the decline of the PC. If Nokia's rumoured tablet appears too, this will further complicate Microsoft's relations with these partners who are essential for the success of Windows 8 (as well as Office and other products). \n \n But, as Holway points out, \"on balance, Microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile. Not doing so would mean certain terminal decline. This way at least holds out some chance of survival.\" \n \n Carolina Milanesi, research vice president at analyst Gartner, said by buying rather than just partnering with Nokia, Microsoft gets deeper integration, the benefit of its patents and removes any risk of Nokia either going Android or being acquired by someone else. \n \n But success against iOS and Android will depend on how the companies integrate. \n \n \"Nokia benefits from higher R&D spend as well as more marketing budget. Microsoft benefits from a good relationship with carriers, good direct channel presence in emerging markets, the potential of going after more aggressively to the business market,\" she told ZDNet. \n \n But for Milanesi, business is a secondary concern, even if it is an attractive target where Microsoft, and to a less extent Nokia, have experience: \"First and foremost it needs to be about consumers. Enterprise are certainly a target especially considering the state BlackBerry is in but consumers make or break a phone vendor today.\" \n \n From Milanesi's point of view, emerging markets need to be a longer term target for Microsoft — but the battle needs to be won in the mature markets first. \n \n For Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson, Nokia adds to Microsoft's developing market strategy. It's looking increasingly likely that the US and western European smartphone market is reaching saturation, so that most growth will come from emerging markets. Here Nokia's Asha devices could play a neat role as an 'on-ramp' for consumers buying their first smartphone. Tied in with a revamped tablet strategy this could open up a new front against Android in particular. \n \n But Husson cautioned: \"This is going to be a long journey. In some countries, Windows Phone 8 market share is now above five percent and close to 10 percent. It thus still offers a limited reach for developers and marketers. \n \n \"Nokia is indeed still massivley popular in some emerging countries but competition is very high with Far East manufacturers and low-cost Android devices. I think it will depend on Microsoft's new strategy for emerging markets beyond just mobile phones.\" \n \n All of this shows the number of competing — and occasionally contradictory — demands upon Microsoft's management. \n \n As the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsoft has a take into account those differing requirements as it tries to build for the future. For example, balancing Microsoft's business customers against the need to get into consumer tech, the need to build its own hardware business against the need to keep manufacturers onside, and building up a mobile business while protecting its PC heritage. \n \n It's easy to look at Apple's integrated hardware and software model and the rich ecosystem that sits around it, but it's much harder to emulate. \n \n Global coverage: Nokia Interim CEO: Microsoft deal makes us stronger | Even with Nokia devices, Microsoft wants to license Windows Phone to other makers | Does its Nokia buy thwart or fuel a possible Microsoft break-up? | Microsoft shows how to flush decades of Nokia goodwill away | Microsoft gets less than $10 per Windows Phone unit | Microsoft-Nokia deal: Reaction from the Twitter trenches | Elop drops Nokia CEO role to lead devices team under Microsoft deal \n \n Further reading ||||| Microsoft is buying Nokia's cell phone business and licensing its patent portfolio, according to both companies. \n \n In 2003, Nokia's cell phone market share exceeded 35%. That same year, its phone business alone posted an operating profit of 5.48 billion euros. Today's sale price, which includes 1.65 billion euros in patents, is just 5.44 billion euros. It's been a rough decade. \n \n Nokia's cell phone collapse has been a spectacular one. The Finnish giant dominated the dumbphone era after Motorola, another faded star that recently fell into the hands of a comparative upstart. But it was blindsided by Apple, then deprived of a chance to regain its footing by an even more aggressive Google, which followed close behind. \n \n The story, in hindsight, is simple: Nokia did not have a truly compelling smartphone ready when a large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones. Whether this was the result of complacency — Nokia was, in the mid-2000s, the leader of the niche smartphone category — doesn't matter now. \n \n Nokia's miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008, the same year Microsoft decided, internally at least, to scrap its ancient and inadequate Windows Mobile platform in favor of something entirely new. Under these circumstances, it's easy to imagine how a sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time, or at least a mutual sympathy. Certainly a shared interest: to break back into the market from which they had been unceremoniously expelled. \n \n During the next two years, while Microsoft readied Windows Phone 7 and Nokia floundered on, the seeds of Sunday's deal were sewn. A chastened Nokia was a natural partner for the tardy but determined Microsoft; it needed a software solution and Microsoft needed help with hardware. The 2009 vision of 2013 renders clearly: Two giants, united after some missteps, regain their rightful place. By 2010, when the head of Microsoft's Business division left to take the helm at Nokia, the gears were moving. Many at the time wondered if Stephen Elop's time at Nokia would be spent grooming the company for purchase — a foreigner in all possible ways, he began his time at the company with a memo rightly but offensively declaring Nokia's proud platform a failure, and quickly pledged the company's commitment to the still-tiny Windows Phone. It felt like a radical about-face, but no matter: Nokia and Microsoft were going to save each other. \n \n Now, with Elop returning to Microsoft after a job well done — well, a job, done —that plan has come to fruition. The only problem is that there's little left to save. Windows Phone has barely dented the now much larger smartphone market. Nokia hasn't had a Windows Phone hit. This incongruity — between a successfully executed, slyly strategic long-term merger plan and a much grander, more general sense of failure — might explain Microsoft's deeply strange and somewhat sad stated goals for its Nokia acquisition. \n \n Microsoft' s \"Strategic Rationale,\" titled \"Accelerating Growth,\" is a disjointed and bizarre document. It manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic. \n \n For example, it lays out a plan to pull in over $45 billion dollars in smartphone revenue by 2018. But it plans on doing this by securing just 15% of the projected global smartphone market — not exactly a world-beating plan, keeping in mind the time frame. Consider: 2018 is five years away. Five years ago was the year the App Store first opened. ||||| Hello there, \n \n \n \n There is a pertinent story about a man who was working on an oil platform in the North Sea. He woke up one night from a loud explosion, which suddenly set his entire oil platform on fire. In mere moments, he was surrounded by flames. Through the smoke and heat, he barely made his way out of the chaos to the platform's edge. When he looked down over the edge, all he could see were the dark, cold, foreboding Atlantic waters. \n \n \n \n As the fire approached him, the man had mere seconds to react. He could stand on the platform, and inevitably be consumed by the burning flames. Or, he could plunge 30 meters in to the freezing waters. The man was standing upon a \"burning platform,\" and he needed to make a choice. \n \n \n \n He decided to jump. It was unexpected. In ordinary circumstances, the man would never consider plunging into icy waters. But these were not ordinary times - his platform was on fire. The man survived the fall and the waters. After he was rescued, he noted that a \"burning platform\" caused a radical change in his behaviour. \n \n \n \n We too, are standing on a \"burning platform,\" and we must decide how we are going to change our behaviour. \n \n \n \n Over the past few months, I've shared with you what I've heard from our shareholders, operators, developers, suppliers and from you. Today, I'm going to share what I've learned and what I have come to believe. \n \n \n \n I have learned that we are standing on a burning platform. \n \n \n \n And, we have more than one explosion - we have multiple points of scorching heat that are fuelling a blazing fire around us. \n \n \n \n For example, there is intense heat coming from our competitors, more rapidly than we ever expected. Apple disrupted the market by redefining the smartphone and attracting developers to a closed, but very powerful ecosystem. \n \n \n \n In 2008, Apple's market share in the $300+ price range was 25 percent; by 2010 it escalated to 61 percent. They are enjoying a tremendous growth trajectory with a 78 percent earnings growth year over year in Q4 2010. Apple demonstrated that if designed well, consumers would buy a high-priced phone with a great experience and developers would build applications. They changed the game, and today, Apple owns the high-end range. \n \n \n \n And then, there is Android. In about two years, Android created a platform that attracts application developers, service providers and hardware manufacturers. Android came in at the high-end, they are now winning the mid-range, and quickly they are going downstream to phones under €100. Google has become a gravitational force, drawing much of the industry's innovation to its core. \n \n \n \n Let's not forget about the low-end price range. In 2008, MediaTek supplied complete reference designs for phone chipsets, which enabled manufacturers in the Shenzhen region of China to produce phones at an unbelievable pace. By some accounts, this ecosystem now produces more than one third of the phones sold globally - taking share from us in emerging markets. \n \n \n \n While competitors poured flames on our market share, what happened at Nokia? We fell behind, we missed big trends, and we lost time. At that time, we thought we were making the right decisions; but, with the benefit of hindsight, we now find ourselves years behind. \n \n \n \n The first iPhone shipped in 2007, and we still don't have a product that is close to their experience. Android came on the scene just over 2 years ago, and this week they took our leadership position in smartphone volumes. Unbelievable. \n \n \n \n We have some brilliant sources of innovation inside Nokia, but we are not bringing it to market fast enough. We thought MeeGo would be a platform for winning high-end smartphones. However, at this rate, by the end of 2011, we might have only one MeeGo product in the market. \n \n \n \n At the midrange, we have Symbian. It has proven to be non-competitive in leading markets like North America. Additionally, Symbian is proving to be an increasingly difficult environment in which to develop to meet the continuously expanding consumer requirements, leading to slowness in product development and also creating a disadvantage when we seek to take advantage of new hardware platforms. As a result, if we continue like before, we will get further and further behind, while our competitors advance further and further ahead. \n \n \n \n At the lower-end price range, Chinese OEMs are cranking out a device much faster than, as one Nokia employee said only partially in jest, \"the time that it takes us to polish a PowerPoint presentation.\" They are fast, they are cheap, and they are challenging us. \n \n \n \n And the truly perplexing aspect is that we're not even fighting with the right weapons. We are still too often trying to approach each price range on a device-to-device basis. \n \n \n \n The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems, where ecosystems include not only the hardware and software of the device, but developers, applications, ecommerce, advertising, search, social applications, location-based services, unified communications and many other things. Our competitors aren't taking our market share with devices; they are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem. This means we're going to have to decide how we either build, catalyse or join an ecosystem. \n \n \n \n This is one of the decisions we need to make. In the meantime, we've lost market share, we've lost mind share and we've lost time. \n \n \n \n On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's informed that they will put our A long term and A-1 short term ratings on negative credit watch. This is a similar rating action to the one that Moody's took last week. Basically it means that during the next few weeks they will make an analysis of Nokia, and decide on a possible credit rating downgrade. Why are these credit agencies contemplating these changes? Because they are concerned about our competitiveness. \n \n \n \n Consumer preference for Nokia declined worldwide. In the UK, our brand preference has slipped to 20 percent, which is 8 percent lower than last year. That means only 1 out of 5 people in the UK prefer Nokia to other brands. It's also down in the other markets, which are traditionally our strongholds: Russia, Germany, Indonesia, UAE, and on and on and on. \n \n \n \n How did we get to this point? Why did we fall behind when the world around us evolved? \n \n \n \n This is what I have been trying to understand. I believe at least some of it has been due to our attitude inside Nokia. We poured gasoline on our own burning platform. I believe we have lacked accountability and leadership to align and direct the company through these disruptive times. We had a series of misses. We haven't been delivering innovation fast enough. We're not collaborating internally. \n \n \n \n Nokia, our platform is burning. \n \n \n \n We are working on a path forward -- a path to rebuild our market leadership. When we share the new strategy on February 11, it will be a huge effort to transform our company. But, I believe that together, we can face the challenges ahead of us. Together, we can choose to define our future. \n \n \n \n The burning platform, upon which the man found himself, caused the man to shift his behaviour, and take a bold and brave step into an uncertain future. He was able to tell his story. Now, we have a great opportunity to do the same. \n \n \n \n Stephen.",
    "summary": "– Why did Microsoft buy Nokia's phone business? We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues—like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company … missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform—a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move—to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone. Of course, Yglesias notes, that move \"was basically a total failure.\" To read the full parable, click here."

    "document": "Closure for mountaineer as remains of friends lost in Himalayas 30 years ago found \n \n Published on 10 December, 2018 \n \n A Kirk official who spent weeks searching for two friends who disappeared in the Himalayas more than 30 years ago has spoken of his relief after their bodies were finally found. \n \n Steve Aisthorpe, 55, was part of an expedition to Pumori on the Nepal-Tibet border with Kristinn Rúnarsson and Thorsteinn Gudjonsson who were last seen alive at a height of 21,650ft on October 18, 1988. \n \n Their remains were discovered last month by an American mountaineer at the snout of the glacier below the climb route which suggests they fell down the face, into the crevasse at its base. \n \n Nepali tea break - L-R - Kristinn Rúnarsson and Thorsteinn Gudjonsson. \n \n Mr Aisthorpe, a mission development worker for the Church of Scotland, said the positioning of the ropes implied that his friends, who were both 27, had either reached, or almost reached, the ridge at the top of the face when disaster struck. \n \n He said it is likely that the remains were slowly carried down the mountain by a retreating glacier over the last 30 years. \n \n The bodies were brought back to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, by a group of local climbers and a cremation service was attended by relatives of the men who took their ashes home to Iceland. \n \n Faith \n \n Mr Aisthorpe of Kincraig in the Highlands said: “The discovery of the remains of Thorsteinn and Kristinn after so many years have inevitably brought many emotions to the surface for all who knew and loved these wonderful guys. \n \n “But it has also brought people together and I pray will help with greater closure and, in time, peace. \n \n “My diary of the expedition reminds me of how, as someone who had only recently embraced the Christian faith, I found comfort and guidance as I turned to God in prayer. \n \n “In the midst of the desperate tasks of searching and then leaving the mountain alone, the words of a Psalm were a personal reality - ‘God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble’. \n \n “I plan to go to Reykjavík in Iceland to meet their families soon and pay my respects.” \n \n Kristinn Rúnarsson by a lone red tent at an Pumori expedition camp. \n \n Mr Aisthorpe said further clues about what exactly happened to the men could emerge because two camera films were found in a pocket of a jacket and have been sent to a specialist in Australia for development. \n \n He became friends with Thorsteinn in 1987 after they were introduced by a mutual friend who was also a mountaineering enthusiast. \n \n Pumori, which is nearly 23,500ft high, is one of Mount Everest’s more challenging neighbours. \n \n The four man expedition, which included Jon Geirsson, established a base camp, 17,388ft below a glacial lake west of Kala Patthar. \n \n Over a 12 day period, the group moved on to set up a high camp on the upper Changri Shar glacier and it was during this time that Mr Geirsson fell ill and decided to return home. \n \n Mr Aisthorpe had also begun to suffer from a gastric flu and on October 16, 1988, he descended to the village of Pheriche to consult the doctor there. \n \n He was told that it would take a week for him to recover so he sent a message back to the high camp suggesting that Thorsteinn and Kristinn “should feel free” to make a summit attempt without him. \n \n They set off and were never seen again. \n \n Kristinn Rúnarsson on the lower part of West face of Pumori. Steve Aisthorpe. \n \n Recalling the tragic episode, Mr Aisthorpe, authorof The Invisible Church, said: “I’ve never felt as alone as the day I arrived back at our high camp. \n \n “As I worked my way upwards, I desperately hoped that Kristinn and Torsteinn had descended safely and were now lying in their sleeping bags in the tiny red tent camp. \n \n “As it came into view, I called out at the top of my voice - my calls echoed from the rocks and ice before fading. \n \n “But the silence was palpable. \n \n “Even as I finally reached and then unzipped the tent, I still nurtured a hope that the boys would be lying there, comatose, sleeping off the climb of their lives. \n \n “But it was empty and I scanned our route up the steep face above, but nothing moved. \n \n “It was then that my guts started to twist and a cold sweat began.” \n \n Steve Aisthorpe. \n \n Mr Aisthorpe said he summoned help and a helicopter search was finally launched five days after the men were last seen. \n \n “In 1988, there were very few helicopters in Nepal and those that existed were not capable of the kinds of searches and rescues that take place in the Himalayas these days,” he added. \n \n “I was onboard and we soared above the site of our high camp and began to scrutinise the lower part of our route. \n \n “Looking down into the deep crevasse that guarded the base of the west face, I expected to see a flash of red or yellow Goretex but there was nothing. \n \n “A couple of weeks later I left the area, convinced that Kristinn and Torsteinn must have fallen somewhere high on the face, and their remains swallowed by the cavernous crevasse below. \n \n “This was what I explained to their families and friends on a visit to Reykjavík shortly after my return from Nepal.” \n \n West face of Pumori taken from helicopter during search in October, 1988. \n \n Described by their friends as a breath of fresh air, Thorsteinn and Kristinn were considered to be Iceland's leading exponents of Himalayan climbing at the time and well known for their open, easy-going personalities. \n \n Kristinn's girlfriend was four months pregnant when he died. \n \n His son, also called Kristinn, is the spitting image of his father and was part of the party that went to Kathmandu for the cremation service. \n \n The tragedy did not put Mr Aisthorpe off Nepal or mountaineering and over the following few years he returned to the country each spring and autumn to guide on some of the smaller peaks. \n \n He became increasingly interested in the country and its people and moved there with his wife Liz and two sons, John and Scott, in 1995 and stayed for 12 years. \n \n The couple worked with the International Nepal Fellowship (INF), a Christian charity involved in health and community development. \n \n Steve Aisthorpe has also spent time in Afghanistan. \n \n The Church of Scotland is one of the founding partners of the United Mission to Nepal (UMN) charity which was established in 1954. \n \n Generous Kirk members have raised nearly £476,000 to help rebuild shattered communities in the Dhading region following a devastating earthquake in 2015. \n \n UMN director Joel Hafvenstein said it would have been “impossible” for the charity and its local partners to help thousands of people if it wasn’t for the Kirk’s Let Us Build a House campaign. \n \n He said the money had made a “tremendous, transformational difference”. \n \n It has enabled UMN and its partners to build 35 earthquake resistant schools with 48 blocks, bio-gas plants, eight community water taps, 350 household toilets, toilet blocks for schools and health centres, repair vital water irrigation systems and mini-hydro plants, reinstate 33 miles of roads and paths and kit out schools with computer suites. \n \n The Kathmandu headquartered organisation has built five earthquake resistant demonstration houses across the Dhading region to inspire people to use the same building techniques and materials in their own reconstruction projects. \n \n Nearly 600 masons have been specially trained to assist them. \n \n All still images supplied by Steve Aisthorpe. ||||| A Scottish mountaineer who spent weeks searching for two friends who disappeared in the Himalayas more than 30 years ago has spoken of finally feeling a sense of closure after their bodies were recently found. \n \n Steve Aisthorpe, 55, was with Kristinn Rúnarsson and Þorsteinn Guðjónsson on an expedition to Pumori on the Nepal-Tibet border when he fell ill partway through the expedition and told his friends to go on without him. \n \n Rúnarsson and Guðjónsson were last seen alive at a height of 21,650ft on 18 October 1988.

    "summary": "– The bodies of those who succumb to the Himalayan mountains likely stay on the slopes forever—it's often too difficult, dangerous, and costly to retrieve them. That fact didn't stop Steve Aisthorpe of Scotland from his recent mission on the Nepal-Tibet border: to get \"closure\" on the fate of Kristinn Runarsson and Thorsteinn Gudjonsson, friends and fellow climbers who vanished during a 1988 expedition with him. Aisthorpe, who the Guardian notes found out just a few weeks ago his friends' bodies had been seen at the end of a glacier on Pumori mountain, recalls on the Church of Scotland's website how his group started as four climbers in October of that year, though one of the men fell ill early on and dropped out. Aisthorpe, then 26, came down with the flu, and so he climbed back down on Oct. 16, 1988, to seek medical attention. When Aisthorpe realized he was in no condition to attempt the climb, he sent a message back to Runarsson and Gudjonsson, both 27 and from Iceland: \"Feel free\" to go for the summit without him. The two men were never seen alive again after Oct. 18. When Aisthorpe finally felt well enough to head back to the last camp where he'd left his friends, \"my calls echoed from the rocks and ice before fading. … the silence was palpable.\" Fast-forward 30 years, when an American climber spotted their bodies just last month; a group of local climbers brought the remains down. Among those at the cremation ceremony in Kathmandu for the men was Runarsson’s 30-year-old son; Runarsson’s fiancee had been pregnant when the father of her child was lost to Pumori. More on their tale here. (Two highly experienced climbers died on El Capitan over the summer.)"

    "document": "From labyrinthine security checkpoints to cramped seats and scant overhead storage space, air travel ranks among the most grueling experiences out there (unless you're one of the rarefied few who spring for first class). With its A350 XWB jet, Airbus integrates the latest design and engineering tricks to quell many of the headaches for flyers, carriers, and pilots. Chief among them? Jet lag. \n \n \"The design process was about optimization, pushing the constraints, and opening up the box of solutions,\" Alain De Zotti, chief engineer of the A350 XWB program at Airbus, says. The manufacturer debuted the design in early 2015, but the first aircraft to land in the United States arrived courtesy of Qatar Airways last week. With the A350, De Zotti's team devised ways that they hope make flying more energy-efficient, aerodynamic, and comfortable. On top of that, they had to ensure that the plane could be just as technologically sound today as at the end of its projected 30-year lifespan. With $15 billion worth of research and development under its belt, Airbus is hoping that its no-nonsense approach to design and engineering will help it best the competition—namely the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 777 long-distance planes. \n \n A Lighter Ride \n \n One of the biggest differences in the Airbus A350 compared to older models is its composition. Over 50% of the structure is made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic for lightweight strength and durability. (The composite is less susceptible to corrosion than traditional aluminum planes.) The material has been deployed in aircrafts in the past, but not in such large proportions. The lighter the plane, the less energy you need to propel it. To help with aerodynamics, the engineers designed the wings to be much larger in size (about 20% bigger than previous generations of planes) and span (about 10% wider) and to have a shape that was inspired by birds' wings. This reduces drag and noise and improves performance at low speeds. The engineers also improved the flap system—typically the flaps follow wind direction but the A350's flaps follow the flight path direction— which makes the ride smoother. These measures—plus ultra-efficient Rolls Royce engines—result in fuel economy that Airbus claims is 25% better than similarly sized planes from competitors. \n \n Eliminating Jet Lag \n \n Qatar Airways currently flies its fleet of A350s to Europe, the United States and Asia—journeys that traverse many time zones. To alleviate the physical toll and stress of screwing with a body's internal clock, the plane is fitted with LED lights that change their color temperature to mimic the sun's natural glow and are timed with natural circadian rhythms. To keep air from feeling stale, the plane's filtering system changes over the air in the plane every two to three minutes. The cabin is pressurized to 6,000 feet, which Airbus claims makes it more comfortable for passengers. \n \n More Room (Thank God) \n \n The fuselage is wider to accommodate larger passenger seats in economy class—just an extra inch over the standard width—and easier movement down the aisles. Because the seat configuration varies from carrier to carrier and the competition for the best business and first class cabins is so fierce—\"Business class is now like first class was and first class is like little apartments,\" De Zotti says—Airbus designed the interior to be adaptable so that carriers can swap out seats and tweak configuration much more easily than in the past. This philosophy extends to the way computer hardware integrates with the design, making avionics and software upgrades are less cumbersome. \n \n \"We're trying to make the jet relevant for the future,\" De Zotti says. \"There's an open architecture that can evolve to welcome new functions and can cope with the evolution of technology.\" \n \n Qatar Airways is one of the first carriers to introduce the A350 to its fleet. Its trip to New York was the first time the plane landed stateside. Heading back to Doha, the plane abruptly aborted takeoff due to a short runway. Though no problems—other than lengthy delivery times—have been reported with the new A350 design, much can go wrong with planes. For example, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has suffered from technical and mechanical problems since its launch. After the 787's launch and popularity with carriers, Airbus retooled its approach with the A350. Let's hope that any kinks in the design were ironed out during its 2,600 hours of test flights. ||||| One of the biggest downsides to a long-haul flight - aside from being cooped up in a metal box for hours - is waiting for your body to readjust to the new time zone once you touch down. But commercial aircraft companies Airbus and Qatar Airways think they might have found a solution to the perennial jetlag problem with their latest aeroplane. \n \n The A350 XWB comes with a variety of improvements designed to minimise that groggy feeling you get from flying halfway around the world. One of the main innovations is a system of LED lights inside the cabin that are designed to change colour to mimic the Sun's natural glow - and they're programmed to fit in with our bodies' natural circadian rhythms no matter what the actual time is. \n \n What's more, the plane's filtering system refreshes the air inside the cabin every 2 or 3 minutes, and keeps it pressurised at the equivalent of an altitude of 1,828.8 metres (6,000 feet). Again, Airbus says this should improve comfort for passengers and minimise the effects of jetlag once they step back onto the ground. \n \n There's much more to this plane besides anti-jetlag measures. Over 50 percent of the frame is made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic, reducing the weight of the aircraft and of course the amount of fuel required for long-haul flights. Larger and wider wings, together with flaps that follow the flight path direction rather than the wind, combine to create a 25 percent improvement in the plane's fuel economy over comparable models currently in the sky, according to Airbus. \n \n In terms of passenger comfort, the economy seats are a little wider and a little further apart, and it's easier to get down the aisles. The interior design of the cabin can be adapted by individual airlines, depending on how they want to make use of the space (and how many business class passengers they're expecting). \n \n \"The design process was about optimisation, pushing the constraints, and opening up the box of solutions,\" Alain De Zotti, chief engineer of the A350 XWB program, told Fast Company. \"We're trying to make the jet relevant for the future. There's an open architecture that can evolve to welcome new functions and can cope with the evolution of technology.\" \n \n Qatar Airways is one of the first airlines to introduce an A350 model to its fleet, but other companies have already placed further orders for the aircraft. If you find jetlag a particular problem when flying between countries, you might want to look out for the new plane in the airport schedules. With US$15 billion in funding and 2,600 hours of test flights behind it, the plane is expected to be in service for the next 30 years.",
    "summary": "– If it works, it could be an air-traveling perk to trump all others: no more jet lag. Airbus is making the bold claim that it can at least reduce the malady for those aboard its new A350 XWB line of jets. The main tool is a set of LED lights within the cabin that mimics natural shifts in sunlight and theoretically keeps people's natural circadian rhythms in sync, reports Fast Company. Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell. The first such jet landed in the US only earlier this month via Qatar Airways, though other airlines plan to add the jet to their fleets, notes a post at Science Alert. (This protein might provide another way to fight jet lag.)"

    "document": "Image copyright PA Image caption Police said the suspected drone had struck an inbound Airbus A320, similar to this one \n \n A police investigation is under way after a passenger plane approaching Heathrow Airport flew into what is believed to have been a drone. \n \n The British Airways flight from Geneva, with 132 passengers and five crew on board, was hit as it approached the London airport at 12:50 BST on Sunday. \n \n If confirmed, it is thought it would be the first such incident in the UK. \n \n BA said it would give the police \"every assistance with their investigation\". No arrests have been made, police say. \n \n The Metropolitan Police said the plane was hit by the drone at about 1,700ft (580m) while flying over the area of Richmond Park, in south west London. \n \n No debris has been found and police have asked for anyone who finds drone parts in the Richmond area to come forward. \n \n The force's aviation security unit, based at Heathrow, is leading the investigation. \n \n 'Very real danger' \n \n After safely landing the plane, the pilot reported an object had struck the front of the Airbus A320. \n \n A BA spokesman said: \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight.\" \n \n Chief Superintendent Martin Hendy, head of the Met's aviation policing command, said the incident highlighted \"the very real dangers of reckless, negligent and some times malicious use of drones\". \n \n A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesman said it was \"totally unacceptable\" to fly drones - which are generally used to capture aerial film or photographs - close to airports. \n \n Steve Landells, from the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), said it had been \"only a matter of time before we had a drone strike\". He called for greater enforcement of existing rules. \n \n Are drones dangerous or harmless fun? \n \n London music video drone footage draws criticism \n \n The rules for flying domestic drones \n \n Analysis \n \n Image copyright PA \n \n Leo Kelion, Technology editor \n \n Flying a drone near an airport can already be punished with up to five years in prison, and rules also forbid flying them \"beyond the direct unaided line of sight\" of the operator or near buildings and crowds of people. Drones may not fly above 400ft (122m). \n \n But the latest incident will only add to the pressure for further steps to be taken. \n \n The US recently introduced a compulsory registration scheme so any drone recovered from an accident can be traced back to its owner. \n \n In addition, officials could make it mandatory for drones to run geo-fencing software - that would prevent them flying in restricted areas. \n \n The Department for Transport has promised to publish a strategy for unmanned aircraft this year. \n \n Pilots have also called for it to fund tests into what would happen if a drone got sucked into an engine or crashed into a plane's windscreen. \n \n Last month, the British Airline Pilots Association noted that while the threat of bird strikes had been well researched, there was little data about how much damage a drone could cause a plane. \n \n The incident follows a warning earlier this year by the head of the International Air Transport Association Tony Tyler that drones flown by the general public are \"a real and growing threat\" to civilian aircraft. \n \n The UK Air Proximity Board - which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace - said there had been a number of serious near-misses at UK airports involving drones. \n \n David Black, from Blackwing Aerial Services - a company that specialises in licensed commercial drones - said education and enforcement of the current rules were important, particularly for hobbyists. \n \n \"I think a register is a good idea,\" he said. \n \n \"With firearms it has shown it's a good thing... but it has not stopped bad guys from getting guns. If you're going to use them as weapons, bad guys can build them themselves. \n \n \"You need enforcement, but the problem with enforcement is that it costs money and people to carry it out.... There needs to be better technology for detection and avoidance.\" \n \n Geo-fencing is available in some drones - a database within the drone will not let it take off if it is near an airport so that operators cannot accidentally fly into trouble. \n \n Mr Landells from Balpa added: \"The law as it stands says you're not supposed to go above 400ft (122m) or 500m away from the base unit, depending on the drone you're using, but we've been seeing incidents up at 8,000 feet, where drones just have no place to be, so we've got to do something. \n \n \"That's a registration process, some sort of tracking, some sort of electronic security - we've got to do something about this.\" \n \n Drone incidents at UK airports \n \n Image copyright BAA \n \n 17 April 2016 - A British Airways plane approaching Heathrow is believed to have hit a drone while in midair \n \n 28 November 2015 - The pilot of an A321 plane narrowly missed a drone hovering at 100ft above a runway at Gatwick Airport \n \n 30 September 2015 - A small drone helicopter passed within 30ft of the cockpit of an A319 plane while on the approach to Heathrow \n \n 22 September 2015 - A \"quadcopter-type drone\" missed the right-hand side of a B777 plane by about 25m while at 2,000ft after it left Heathrow Airport \n \n 13 September 2015 - A silver drone with a \"balloon-like\" centre missed an E170 aircraft by about 20m, while the plane was approaching London City Airport over the Thames \n \n 13 September 2015 - A drone flew over the top of a B737 aircraft while at 4,000ft, missing it by about 5m, shortly after it left Stansted \n \n 27 August 2015 - A DO328 aircraft flew within 50ft of a drone while approaching Manchester Airport at 2,800ft \n \n Source: The UK Airprox Board ||||| Story highlights London police seek public's help in finding operator of drone that may have struck airliner \n \n No one was hurt and the plane wasn't damaged, but authorities worry about potential for catastrophe \n \n London (CNN) Did a drone hit an airliner trying to land at London's Heathrow Airport? \n \n The pilot of a British Airways flight certainly thinks so, and now authorities would like to find out who might have been behind the weekend incident. \n \n British Airways Flight BA727 from Geneva was approaching Heathrow on Sunday afternoon when what the pilot believed to be a drone struck the front of the aircraft, London Metropolitan Police said.

    "summary": "– In what the UK's Civil Aviation Authority says would be \"a totally unacceptable\" first, a British Airways plane landing at Heathrow appears to have been hit by a drone on Sunday, the BBC reports. The Airbus A320 coming into London from Geneva had 132 passengers and five crew members aboard, a BA spokesman tells CNN; the incident was reported after the BA pilot touched down. \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight,\" the rep says. No arrests have been made (it's unclear whose drone it may have been), and the aviation security arm of the Metropolitan Police is looking into the matter. Police note that flying a drone too close to a plane is illegal, NBC News reports, with punishment including up to five years in prison. Specifically, drones over 15 pounds can't fly higher than 400 feet and aren't permitted to fly \"beyond the direct unaided line of sight\" of its operator or near crowds or buildings. Not that the incident came as a total surprise: The head of the International Air Transport Association had previously noted the \"real and growing threat\" of a drone-plane hit, while a British Airline Pilots Association rep says it was \"only a matter of time.\" A recent study by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone underscores the danger in US airspace, with 327 \"close encounters\" of drones flying within 500 feet of manned aircraft between December 2013 and September 2015, and at least 28 pilots \"[maneuvering] to avoid a collision with a drone.\" Frighteningly, aviation experts say they don't really know what would happen if a drone got sucked into a plane's engine, a Civil Aviation Authority rep tells NBC.

But the situation there is very devastating.\" ||||| Major relief packages have continued to pour into the typhoon-devastated city of Tacloban – from food aid to medicine and search-and-rescue teams – on the second day of a ramped-up effort by the Philippines government to reach those hardest hit by the super storm that many fear has killed more than 10,000 people. \n \n The aid comes amid heightened insecurity and tension in the city, where reports of gunshots, stabbings and ambushes have caused many residents and aid workers to fear for their lives. \n \n Local and American military C-130 planes were flying in with supplies on Thursday, while the USS George Washington, an aircraft carrier that can accommodate the landing of helicopters, was expected to arrive off the coast. \n \n An American medical ship has been ordered but would not arrive for another few weeks. British digger maker JCB announced it would send heavy machinery and generators to help clear up the debris that still lines the streets. \n \n Despite the arrival of aid and a concerted effort by the military to restore order to the town, thousands of stricken residents still crammed the crumbling airport desperate for a way out of the city that has borne the brunt of the storm and its aftermath. \n \n On Wednesday night the Tacloban mayor, Alfred Romualdez, led a mass burial in a graveyard just outside the city. Officials said every effort had been made to ensure those buried could be identified in the weeks to come. \n \n The official death toll of 2,357 is a considerably lower figure than that estimated by aid workers, who say the lack of information coming from various areas – some 29 municipalities in all are affected – could mean that the devastation is far greater than yet realised. Most casualties seem to have been around the islands of Samar and Leyte, where the storm first made landfall at 195mph on Friday morning, with accompanying sea surges of up to 20ft. \n \n The resulting damage in the region – a coastal flatland that has seen whole villages blown apart by the storm's heavy winds and rain – has created a state of pandemonium in Tacloban, where survivors have had to loot shops and malls for water, while others have resorted to scavenging for food among the bloated bodies of the dead. \n \n On Wednesday stories of heightened violence and tension circulated around the city as eight were killed after stampeding a rice warehouse looking for food. A Philippine Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men who were later shot dead by police, and a 13-year-old boy was knifed in the neck and stomach by unknown men, AFP reported. There were unverified reports that prisoners from the local jail, who had successfully broken out of their cells after the storm, were ambushing people carrying supplies across San Juanico bridge, which connects Tacloban with Samar island. \n \n A Facebook status warning of traffickers posing as relief workers and targeting women and children circulated on Thursday but the Guardian was not able to verify the report. Officials urged people to stay calm and not believe everything they heard. \"There have been so many reports of looting and rape which have turned out not to be correct,\" Ricky Caradang, a spokesman for President Benigno Aquino III, told the local ABS-CBN TV channel. \n \n A nighttime curfew has been in place since Monday and in a televised report on Wednesday the BBC correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes said Tacloban had turned into a \"war zone\". Footage showed tanks rolling through the centre of the devastated town and soldiers crouching behind walls with automatic rifles. Just what the threat was to the city had not been made clear, he said. \n \n Some aid agencies, fearing for the safety of their employees, have ordered teams to evacuate. Plan International has withdrawn all 15 of its employees – normally permanently based in Tacloban – until security is restored in the city, according to spokesman Ian Wishart. The fact that many aid workers had arrived in Tacloban but little aid had yet been distributed was creating a security concern, one aid worker told the Guardian. A memo was circulating among relief workers advising them not to move around in Tacloban as some UN staff had already been pulled out for security reasons. \n \n But officials have pointed to an increased presence of police and military, and the arrival of aid, as a turning point for the ravaged city. \n \n Carandang said 26 of 138 barangays (neighbourhoods) in Tacloban had received aid, with many of the roads previously blocked by fallen trees and debris now cleared. \n \n Oxfam has sent enough emergency water supplies for 20,000 families in Tacloban on a first-run delivery of effort, although the charity added that delivery was dependent on a stable security situation in the town itself. \n \n Plans are to provide half a million people affected by the super storm with emergency shelter, water and construction materials to rebuild their homes and boats. The World Food Programme successfully delivered nearly 25 tonnes of high-energy biscuits on Wednesday and another 10 tonnes were on their way, the UN body said. \n \n Much of the devastation wrought by Haiyan occurred in the Philippines' agricultural belt, with the majority of residents in Leyte and Samar working on farms or as fishermen. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes: \"Progress is being made\" \n \n The relief operation in the central Philippines to help those affected by Typhoon Haiyan is making progress following the arrival of a US aircraft carrier and its escort of two cruisers. \n \n More victims are receiving help but a BBC correspondent at the scene says there is still no large-scale food distribution taking place. \n \n The first mass burials have been carried out in Tacloban. \n \n The confirmed death toll, more than 2,300, is expected to continue rising. \n \n More than 11 million people have been affected by the typhoon, according to the UN. \n \n Unprecedented \n \n The top US commander in the Philippines told the BBC that US military support would be on an unprecedented scale. \n \n The USS George Washington, carrying 5,000 crew and moored off the east of Samar island, will expand search-and-rescue operations and provide a platform for helicopters to move supplies, the White House said. \n \n Two US destroyers are already in the Philippines and other US vessels are expected to arrive in about a week, the US Navy said. \n \n Pallets loaded with food and water have been taken from the aircraft carrier to Tacloban, the capital of badly hit Leyte province, and Guiuan, which was also devastated by the typhoon, on Samar's east coast. \n \n Image caption The big international aid operation is being given a further boost by the arrival of a US aircraft carrier \n \n Image caption Survivors have been forming long queues in the worst hit areas to collect food and water \n \n Image caption Aid officials are trying to gain a more accurate picture of the typhoon damage from the air \n \n Image caption Many buildings were flattened by the storm and others heavily damaged including this church in Tacloban \n \n US Marine Brigadier General Paul Kennedy told BBC Radio 5 live that the US aid effort was being stepped up to a level that has \"probably never been applied\" to a humanitarian crisis. \n \n The presence of the USS George Washington is expected to triple the number of available helicopters, which can also deliver hundreds of thousands of gallons of water every day. \n \n Food, water and medical help are beginning to reach residents of Tacloban as soldiers clear roads blocked by debris. \n \n But thousands of people continued to line up at the city's airport on Thursday to escape the difficult conditions. \n \n Aid at a glance Asian Development Bank: $500m (£312m) emergency loans and $23m in grants Australia: A$30m ($28m, £17m) package, including aircraft, medical staff, shelter materials, water containers and hygiene kits China: 10m yuan ($1.6m; £1m) in relief goods plus $200,000 (£120,000) from government and Red Cross European Commission: $11m (£6.8m) Indonesia: Logistical aid including aircraft, food, generators and medicine Japan: $10m (£6.2m), including tents and blankets.

French aid charity MSF described the situation there as bleak. \n \n But the BBC's Andrew Harding, reporting from near Guiuan, says after earlier problems with looting, some supplies are now getting in. \n \n Other countries have also pledged help in the shape of financial aid, relief supplies or emergency teams. \n \n The UK government is sending the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious, more than £20m ($32m) in aid, a team of medical experts and an RAF transport aircraft. \n \n China's latest pledge of $1.6m still looks pointedly small besides its previous aid packages to other nations - even to Japan, with whom it is also squabbling over territory China's aid controversy \n \n Japan is also preparing to send up to 1,000 troops as well as naval vessels and aircraft, Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said. \n \n China - which is engaged in a territorial dispute with the Philippines - is sending 10m yuan ($1.6m; £1m) in relief goods. \n \n Its initial pledge of $200,000 (£120,000) from the government and Chinese Red Cross combined drew criticism in US media, but was also condemned by some Chinese internet users as excessive. \n \n Unprecedented logistics \n \n Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful storms ever recorded on land, hit the Philippines last Friday. \n \n Tacloban's airport was left in ruins by the storm, but in recent days US military planes have been arriving with World Food Programme supplies.

Power generators were flooded as well. \n \n Most of the aid is stuck in Manila and the nearby airport of Cebu, a 45-minute flight away. \n \n \"There's a lot of dead bodies outside. There's no water, no food,\" said Dr. Victoriano Sambale, one of the dozen medical workers tending to thousands of people at the airport clinic. \n \n Until Wednesday there was no anesthetic. \n \n \"Patients had to endure the pain,\" Sambale said. \n \n Clutching her swollen belly, 26-year-old Reve Rose was writhing on her side on a wooden bench as her husband looked on.

More than 100,000 bags of rice were carted away in the melee, according to news reports Wednesday. \n \n Elsewhere, residents dug up underground pipes and smashed them open to get water. \n \n PHOTOS: Central Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan \n \n The official death toll stood at 2,275, but aid workers feared it would continue to grow. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people were affected by the storm, one of the most powerful ever to make landfall. \n \n As concerns grew about rampant looting and lawlessness, Philippine security forces sent reinforcements and imposed a nighttime curfew in Tacloban. Armed assailants have been holding up aid convoys headed to the city. On Tuesday, troops killed two suspected communist rebels who attacked one such convoy, the military said. \n \n Local officials said bands of looters, having cleaned out shops in Tacloban, were beginning to break into the homes of people who had died or fled the city. But there were reports that newly arrived troops were restoring order. \n \n Flights delivering aid from around the world are arriving at the airport in Cebu, which has been turned into a logistics hub for the relief effort. The many donations included a field hospital from Belgium and a portable purification plant from Germany, according to European officials. \n \n By the end of the day Wednesday, the United States had delivered nearly 274,000 pounds of supplies to Tacloban, about 100 miles northeast of Cebu, said two senior Obama administration officials who briefed reporters in Washington on condition of anonymity. The shipments included plastic tarps, hygiene kits, blankets and medical supplies. \n \n U.S. military personnel had also evacuated about 800 people from Tacloban to Manila for medical treatment. \n \n Philippine welfare personnel loaded up packages of rice and canned food provided by the World Food Program and distributed them to nearly 50,000 Tacloban residents. But even there, where the bulk of assistance has been delivered, bodies still lined the streets because, authorities said, there were not enough hands to remove them. \n \n Hundreds of additional Marines are expected to arrive in the Philippines by week's end to bolster the relief effort, which has struggled against logistical hurdles and the scale of the devastation. \n \n Aid has yet to reach many victims of the typhoon, known by Filipinos as Yolanda, particularly on outlying islands. \n \n \"The major challenge is logistics,\" said Mathias Eick, a regional spokesman for the European Commission's humanitarian aid directorate. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities — military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross — trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" \n \n Some of the logistical problems eased Wednesday, as remote airstrips and major roads were cleared of debris. However, fuel shortages and lack of power remain problems in rural areas. \n \n The longer the aid takes to arrive, the more people try to leave. Every day, desperate residents gather at Tacloban airport hoping for a spot on one of the departing supply planes. \n \n \"It's a very natural decision to take,\" Eick said. \"However, that of course makes it difficult for aid agencies to find out where people are going to, where people are staying, and how much is needed in the various towns.\" \n \n With much of the aid headed to Tacloban, on the island of Leyte, concern is growing for other hard-hit communities, such as the port of Ormoc. \n \n \"There is enough food in Ormoc for about two or three days, but if aid doesn't come through soon ... the situation could descend into chaos,\" said Julien Anseau, a spokesman for the U.S.-based aid group ChildFund International. \"What we are seeing is aid coming into Ormoc, but it's not staying in Ormoc, it's going on to Tacloban.\" \n \n An assessment team from the international aid group Doctors Without Borders visited Guiuan, in Eastern Samar province, where the typhoon first made landfall. \n \n \"The village has been flattened — houses, medical facilities, rice fields, fishing boats, all destroyed. People are living out in the open; there are no roofs left standing in the whole of Guiuan,\" team leader Alexis Moens said in a statement. \"The needs are immense, and there are a lot of surrounding villages that are not yet covered by any aid organizations.\" \n \n Defending the relief effort, Philippine Cabinet Secretary Rene Almendras said Wednesday that major roads have been cleared of debris and authorities have reached all but four affected areas to assess the needs. Additional logistics hubs are being established in Ormoc and at an airstrip in Guiuan. \n \n Aid deliveries will accelerate, Almendras told reporters. \"It's just we have not seen anything on the magnitude that we are talking now.\" \n \n Amid the devastation, there were heartwarming moments of resilience. Daryl Dano flew from Manila to Tacloban to search for her family, whom she found alive. When she arrived in the morning, she said residents were busy sifting through the vast fields of debris for anything they could salvage. But at night, she said, she was amazed to see people light a bonfire and gather in a circle to sing. \n \n \"They were sitting like Boy Scouts, sharing survival stories and what they did,\" she said. \"They were sometimes even making jokes about the destruction around them. \n \n \"I asked them why or how they could laugh?\" she said. A person replied, \"I just have to think happy thoughts. This is my second life. I just have to move on from this point to the next.\" \n \n [For the Record, 11:47 a.m. PST Nov. 14: In an earlier version of this post, Mathias Eick's last name was incorrectly given as Rick.] \n \n alexandra.zavis@latimes.com \n \n De Leon is a special correspondent.",

The USS George Washington and two US cruisers have arrived in the Philippines and will distribute food, water, and medicine, as well as assist search and rescue operations in what the top US commander in the Philippines tells the BBC will be an American aid effort on an unprecedented scale. US planes are bringing in supplies and a medical ship is on the way; Britain is also sending an aircraft carrier, notes the BBC. In other developments: Supplies from the US and other countries are arriving, but some areas are still in desperate need of relief and \"the major challenge is logistics,\" a European Commission spokesman tells the LA Times. \"With all this aid arriving and at the same time, the various Philippine authorities—military, civilian structures, the Philippine Red Cross—trying to distribute aid to so many communities ... obviously there are bottlenecks.\" Lawlessness in the devastated city of Tacloban is also slowing the distribution of aid, the Guardian finds. A Red Cross convoy was allegedly hijacked by armed men and there are rumors that inmates who escaped during the storm have been ambushing people carrying supplies. Communist rebels have declared a ceasefire in disaster areas, but troops say there has been at least one attack. Some 2,357 people have been confirmed dead, but the toll is expected to rise significantly as remote areas hit hard by the storm are reached. In Tacloban, where bodies are being trucked to mass graves, the city administrator says he is sticking by his original estimate of 10,000 dead in the city alone. In a smaller city south of Tacloban, the devastation is even worse and a 16-member medical team from California is laboring in extreme conditions to help survivors, NBC finds. The volunteer surgeons—working by flashlight in Tanawan's ruined town hall—believe the region will need help for months. \"I don’t know when or how we are going to be able to leave,\" one doctor says. \"This is just the beginning of a wave of misery.\" USA Today has more on that front: The few doctors in Manila are already overwhelmed with hundreds of patients—and those are mostly minor injuries. They're soon expecting to see big problems like pneumonia, diarrhea, infections, and dehydration. And the New York Times looks at a hospital in Tacloban that has no power, where victims lay waiting for care. Food, water, and medical supplies are short; one patient interviewed by the Times says he has not received painkillers, antibiotics, or even an antiseptic for his wounds."

How did Aboud Rogo and the other people at the Masjid Musa come to misunderstand the religion they were dedicated to living out properly? Surely the learned imam Pope Francis is on his way to Kenya now in order to […] ||||| One of the foundational principles of the Bush Doctrine was/is the oft-repeated dictum, \"You are either with us or against us.\" Little did President Bush know that the American Muslim community was .... against us. George Bush believed that the moderates in the Muslim world would denounce/destroy the devout (\"radical\"), a war within Islam that never took place. Imagine Bush's dismay when he discovered that no one was behind him, like John Belushi in Animal House when he goes running out the front door shouting, \"Who's with me?!?,\" only to discover that he is utterly alone. \n \n The faked hate narrative that Muslim groups and leaders use is now the default talking point any time that jihad or patriotism, for that matter, is being discussed. If Muslims spent as much time instituting programs in mosques and Islamic centers against jihad recruitment and the jihadic doctrine as they do fighting the myth of islamophobia, the world would be a vastly safer place. \n \n \n \n Muslim groups allege that Muslims have become targets of \"violent threats\" because of American Sniper. Nobody believes it. They are demanding that \"American Sniper\" director Clint Eastwood and actor Bradley Cooper denounce the alleged hateful language directed at Muslims because of the film. This it is what they do -- victim jihad. When one part of the Muslim world kills, the other half cries victim. Whack and whine. It is a distraction to get people to stop talking jihad and instead address their demands. \n \n Apparently, Muslim groups are claiming that a couple of tweets offended their sensibilities. They want action! More like submission. It's called free speech, brutes. \n \n Why don't Muslim groups demand that leaders of the Muslim world, imams, Al Azhar university, et al denounce the hateful, racist, anti-semitic, misogynist, anti-kuffar language in the Qur'an that is responsible for all of these Muslim wars across the world? \n \n The idea that the film \"glorifies war and sanitizes Kyle\" is laughable. The only war talk or war movie that the left enjoys is a war in which the US loses or stands down. The left demands that we hang our heads in shame if we triumph. Which is why \"American Sniper\" is such an invigorating breath of fresh air. \n \n As for \"sanitizing Kyle,\" let's get real. It is the enemedia and the elites that sanitize jihad and Islam. And they do it every day in every news story. Hollywood doesn't just sanitize jihad and Islam, they avoid them all costs. It is the gravest threat to freedom, and Hollywood pretends that it doesn't exist. \n \n As my penpal Daniel F. points out, \"Now it’s American Muslims who are complaining about 'violent threats,' allegedly incited by the hit movie American Sniper. And this time the media is trumpeting this story. Two rules of history converge here: \n \n 1) When Muslims in an a non-Muslim country reach a certain critical mass, they seek to dominate the surrounding community – and then move on from there. cf. Britain, Germany, Sweden and France, inter alia. \n \n 2) Free speech is unknown in the Muslim world, actually it’s anathema. So it starts with trying to shut us up and stopping us from casting Islam in a negative light. And does it work? For one thing, you can be certain the entertainment industry is now poring over their scripts and deleting 'offending' sections. Other 'projects' will simply bite the dust. Of course, Obama didn’t need cajoling. As soon as he took office he banned certain phrases from the government’s lexicon that might reflect poorly on the Muslim religion. Makes you wonder what that man is all about, doesn’t it?\" \n \n For the record, I saw the film back in December when it was first given a very limited release -- just two theaters in NYC. I loved it. I tweeted that it was the best film in decades. It's hardly a rah-rah cheerleading film. It is a film about a deeply good and decent man, a true American patriot. \n \n The record breaking box-office numbers show how out of touch the elites are with the American people. \n \n \"Group says 'American Sniper' film spurs threats against Muslims,\" By Mark Guarino, Reuters, January 24, 2015 \n \n CHICAGO- An Arab-American civil rights organization has asked \"American Sniper\" director Clint Eastwood and actor Bradley Cooper to denounce hateful language directed at U.S. Arabs and Muslims after the release of the film about a Navy marksman.",

Robert Spencer, co-founder of the Jihad Watch and Stop Islamization of America (recently hacked) blogs denied any responsibility for the attack, calling his writings a \"defense of human rights.\" If \"somebody gets from that that they should kill, well then he's nuts,\" he told NBC News. But some observers believe heated hate speech can trigger such actions. “When you push the demonization of populations, you often end up with violence,” warned the research director for the Southern Poverty Law Center. The manifesto also frequently cites the blog Atlas Shrugs by Muslim-basher Pamela Gellar, who insisted that if anyone incited Breivik to violence \"it was Islamic supremacists.\" One expert called the Norwegian tragedy a \"wake up call\" for US security. A 2009 Department of Homeland Security report warned of a growing threat from home-grown right-wing extremists and hate groups. “We could have a similar attack here, and that’s my greatest fear,” said former federal terror analyst Daryl Johnson.

    "document": "\n \n (Palin's home, AP Photo) \n \n Joe McGinniss is a particular sort of journalist unfortunately not so in vogue anymore. His own obsessiveness and personal involvement invariably become part of the story. In his book about the 1968 presidential election, The Selling of the President, one of the most seminal campaign books ever written, he managed to inject himself as a constant shadow presence in the Nixon camp and wrote the model for fly-on-the-wall journalism as well as the basic manual for all future media consultants. His account in Fatal Vision of Jeffrey McDonald’s murder of his pregnant wife and two children is a classic in crime reporting and, as well, one of the stranger tales of an author’s tangled relationship with and dogged pursuit of his subject.McGinniss's hyper-involvement with his stories has bedeviled his subjects, publishers, and critics (Janet Malcolm’s famous study of journalism, The Journalist and the Murder—“Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible…\"—is based on McGinniss). It is now bedeviling Sarah Palin and the right wing.Before almost any other journalist (save for Andrew Sullivan), McGinniss got on to the weird and aberrant nature of the Palin phenomenon. He has been tracking it—and her—in his obsessive fashion nearly since John McCain announced her nomination.Now McGinniss has moved into the house next door to the Palins' in Alaska. He overlooks “my children’s play area” and “Piper’s bedroom,\" Palin complains in one of her Facebook posts about McGinniss. She goes on at considerable length and in stuck-pig fashion to try to mock and demonize and shake McGinniss. She has recruited other right-wing media personalities, including Glenn Beck , to help her in her campaign to run McGinniss out of town. Beck, indeed, has called McGinniss a stalker (which, in shoe-leather journalism fashion, he surely is).The campaign against McGinniss is a pretty stunning abuse of the kind of media access and power that Palin & Co. possess—it’s crowd incitement. Palin, one of the leading political figures in the country, is trying to impede a journalist’s obvious right to cover her by using well-honed and scarily effective right-wing tactics: declaring a jihad on an adversary and having masses of followers deliver threatening hate mail (or hate spam) and other invective of vast and malevolent proportions.McGinniss has sent friends and contacts an email saying that his standard email account had been overwhelmed and he can no longer use it.The Palin campaign is certainly tough for McGinniss and a display of the crude power and bullying that Palin seems to have no second thoughts about using to further her interests.But truly I wouldn’t feel too worried about Joe. Not a lot of chance he’s going to be scared off. He’s Br'er Rabbit.

Listening to today’s press conference, you’d think the administration has been working with single-minded focus on the Gulf gusher since the start of the disaster. In reality, their focus has been anything but singular to help solve this monumental problem. \n \n \n \n If the President really was fully focused on this issue from day one, why did it take nine whole days before the administration asked the Department of Defense for help in deploying equipment needed for the extreme depth spill site? \n \n \n \n Why was the expert group assembled by Energy Commissioner Steven Chu only set up three weeks after the start of this disaster? \n \n \n \n Why was Governor Jindal forced more than a month after the start of the disaster to go on national television to beg for materials needed to tackle the oil spill and for federal approval to build offshore sand barriers that are imperative to protect his state’s coastline? \n \n \n \n Why was no mention of the spill made by our President for days on end while Americans waited to hear if he grasped the import of his leadership on this energy issue? \n \n \n \n Why have several countries and competent organizations who offered help or expertise in dealing with the spill not even received a response back from the Unified Area Command to this day? \n \n \n \n The President claimed that “this notion that somehow the federal government is somehow sitting on the sidelines and for the last three or four or five weeks we’ve just been letting BP make a whole bunch of decisions is simply not true.” But, in fact, that is how U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen described the Obama administration’s approach to this crisis: “We keep a close watch.” \n \n \n \n Listening to the President, you get the impression he is continually surprised by the inability of various centralized government agencies to get more involved and help solve problems. His lack of executive experience might explain this because he is apparently unaware that it’s his job as a chief executive to make sure they do their jobs and help solve problems. \n \n \n \n The fundamental problem at the core of this crisis is a lack of responsibility. (I risk the President taking my comments personally, but they’re not intended to be personal; my comments reflect what many others feel, and we just want to help him tackle this enormous spill problem.) There’s a culture of buck-passing at the heart of this administration that has caused the tragedy of a sunken oil rig to turn into a potential disaster. \n \n \n \n The 1990 Oil Pollution Act was drafted in response to the Exxon-Valdez spill in my home state. It created new procedures for offshore cleanups, specifically putting the federal government in charge of such operations. The President should have used the authority granted by the OPA – immediately – to take control of the situation. That is a big part of what the OPA is for – to designate who is in charge so finger-pointing won’t disrupt efforts to just “plug the d#*! hole.” But instead of immediately engaging with this crisis, our President chose to spend precious time on political pet causes like haranguing the state of Arizona for doing what he himself was supposed to do – secure the nation’s border. He also spent much time fundraising and politicking for liberal candidates and causes while we waited for him to grasp the enormity of the Gulf spill. \n \n \n \n Now that the American people are calling him out on his lack of engagement with this disaster, the buck-passing is in full swing – and, unbelievably, his administration is still looking to blame his predecessor. Amazingly, even those of us who support energy independence for America are the brunt of some buck-passing. \n \n \n \n He suggested today that a “culture of corruption” at the U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) was solely the previous administration’s responsibility and that the failure of the inspection system was a failure of that administration. That is false. The MMS has been his responsibility since January 20, 2009. \n \n \n \n The MMS director who resigned today, Elizabeth Birnbaum, was appointed by his administration. And the most recent inspection of the oil rig took place a mere 10 days before the explosion – also very much on his watch, not President Bush’s. \n \n \n \n The President is also now attempting to somehow distance himself from his administration’s recent decision to open a few areas of the continental shelf to oil and gas exploration. That’s unfortunate because America desperately needs our domestic oil and natural gas. We rely on it for our prosperity, security, and freedom. The President’s decision to open a few areas to offshore exploration was the right decision then; and unlike his quickly evolving position on energy development now, I continue to believe it’s the right decision today – because energy independence is in the long-term economic and security interests of the United States. \n \n \n \n As I explained in an article in National Review last year, conventional sources like natural gas “can act as a clean ‘bridge fuel’ to a future when more renewable sources are available.” I do not, as the President mistakenly believes, think we can “drill, baby, drill” our way out of all of our troubles. As I have consistently stated, we need an “all of the above” approach to energy independence that combines conventional drilling with energy conservation and renewable-energy development. My record in Alaska clearly shows my commitment to this “all of the above” approach. Over 20 percent of Alaska’s electricity currently comes from renewable sources. As governor, I put forward a long-term plan to increase that figure to 50 percent by 2025, which is the most ambitious renewable energy target in the nation. I take great pride in helping to make Alaska, in the words of the New York Times, “a Frontier for Green Power,” even as we continue to embrace the need to “drill, baby, drill” at the same time. \n \n \n \n Alaska can be that frontier for renewable energy only because our conventional oil and gas reserves provide us with “a bridge” to a greener energy future. In fact, Alaska has enough reserves of both oil and gas to help the United States cross that bridge – if only we are allowed to drill! \n \n \n \n Please, Mr. President, hear me on this, if nothing else: if it’s your administration’s decision to suspend the leases of new oil field developments off the coast of Alaska in response to the Gulf’s deepwater spill, and you still remain committed to locking up ANWR and other oil-rich lands, please know you are making a mistake. Unless we continue to drill here and drill now, we risk digging ourselves deeper into the hole created by our continued dependence on foreign energy – which often comes from regimes that care nothing for our prosperity or security, and even less for global environmental safety. \n \n \n \n We need affordable, reliable, secure, environmentally-sound, and domestically-produced energy, but this administration continues to lock up federal land filled with huge energy reserves. If there is to be a moratorium on offshore development, then it’s time we stop ignoring our safest options for domestic development – places like ANWR and NPR-A in my home state of Alaska. \n \n \n \n And it’s time for the administration to stop passing the buck and get control of the disaster in the Gulf. There’s a reason why Harry Truman had that famous sign on his desk. The “buck stops” with the occupant of the Oval Office. When the American people elected President Obama they gave him responsibility to handle this disaster. He promised to “heal the earth, and watch the waters recede...” or something far-fetched like that. It was unbelievable then, it’s impossible now, but what I believe he meant was that he promised to be held accountable. With all due respect, Mr. President, you have a huge job in front of you. We hope you’re learning. Please learn that we must have domestic energy development, you must stop looking backward and blaming Bush, and we must all work together to “plug the d#*! hole.” \n \n \n \n - Sarah Palin \n \n ||||| After Sarah Palin suggested that there is a connection between Obama's response to oil spill and BP's financial contributions to him on Fox News Sunday, Robert Gibbs shot down her accusations on Face the Nation. \n \n PALIN: Well, I think that there is, perhaps, a hesitancy, to -- I don't really know how to put this, Chris, except to say that the oil companies who have so supported President Obama in his campaign and are supportive of him now, I don't know why the question isn't asked by the mainstream media and by others if there's any connection with the contributions made to President Obama and his administration and the support by the oil companies to the administration -- if there's any connection there to President Obama taking so doggone long to get in there, to dive in there and grasp the complexity and the potential tragedy that we are seeing here in the Gulf of Mexico. Now if this was President Bush or if this were a Republican in office who hadn't received as much support even as President Obama has from BP and other oil companies, you know the mainstream media would be all over his case in terms of asking questions, why the administration didn't get in there -- didn't get in there and make sure that the regulatory agencies were doing what they were doing with the oversight to make sure that things like this don't happen. \n \n Gibbs: Palin Should Get More Informed About Drilling: \n \n \"Sarah Palin was involved in that election, but I don't think, apparently, was paying a whole lot of attention,\" Gibbs said. \"I'm almost sure that the oil companies don't consider the Obama administration a huge ally - we proposed a windfall profits tax when they jacked their oil prices up to charge for gasoline.\" \"My suggestion to Sarah Palin would be to get slightly more informed as to what's going on in and around oil drilling in this country,\" he added. \n \n As CBS noted, the back and forth between Palin and Gibbs continued after he was on the air. They also did a bit of fact checking on campaign donations on all sides from the oil companies including Palin. \n \n According to Open Secrets.org, BP's campaign contributions during the 2008 election cycle were $214,915 to Democrats, and $315,909 to Republicans (about 40/60), split almost evenly between individual contributions and PACs. According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, during Palin's 2006 run for Governor in Alaska (where the large majority of donations came from individuals), BP America made the fifth-largest donation by a company to her campaign, contributing $4,650, with BP Alaska giving an additional $250. \n \n As Media Matters pointed out after the right wing started calling this Obama's Katrina, the administration did respond to the spill immediately, so that part of her argument falls flat as well. The response has been inadequate and they should not have trusted BP's early estimates on how much oil was leaking, but you can't say they weren't out there from day one. Their bigger problem was not cleaning up the MMS and catering to the \"drill baby drill\" crowd like Palin in order to get some bipartisan support for their energy legislation. \n \n Chris Wallace also allowed Palin to do some revisionist history when she claimed that she knows \"what it takes to hold these oil companies accountable\". Uh...not so much. \n \n Palin’s Exxon Valdez account draws guffaws: \n \n Sarah Palin’s new memoir, “Going Rogue,” already has been strongly criticized by John McCain’s aides for her account as a vice presidential candidate on the ticket with him in their unsuccessful 2008 race for the White House. Now, add Alaskan experts who were involved in the case over the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster saying her account over her role in the litigation is distorted for a number of reasons. In the book, Palin claims to have helped the fishermen, Alaska Natives and other individuals suing Exxon over spill damages prevail in their legal case. “It took years for Alaska to achieve victory. As governor, I directed our attorney general to write an amicus brief in the case, and, thanks to Alaska’s able attorneys arguing in front of the highest court in the land, in 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the people,” she writes in her book. “Finally, Alaskans could recover some of their losses.” But Palin’s claims of victory for the plaintiffs and of playing a role in achieving that victory are highly distorted, said the chief attorney for the approximately 32,000 plaintiffs that sued Exxon over damages from the worst oil-tanker spill in U.S. waters. “That is the most cockamamie bullshit,” said Dave Oesting of Anchorage, lead plaintiff attorney in the private litigants’ civil case against Exxon and its successor, Exxon Mobil Corp. “She didn’t have a damn thing to do with it, and she didn’t know what it was about.” Read on... \n \n And as I already noted, the Bush administration DOJ shut down a criminal investigation of BP, so there was no accountability. \n \n Scott West: The U.S. Government Has Taught BP That it Can Do Whatever it Wants: \n \n SCOTT WEST: But by August of '07, something had shifted dramatically, and we were told by the US attorney's office in Alaska that the case would settle out for corporate misdemeanor. And at the meeting that I attended there in late August, the question was asked, if we had to go to trial today, what could we prove? And I had to admit that a trial at that moment, the most we could prove was a corporate misdemeanor. And then I said, \"But we’re not done with our investigation. We’ve only just begun. We need another couple of years to really vet this out.\" And they said, well, can I guarantee that I would be able to convict individuals. And I said, \"Of course not. You can’t guarantee anything like that in the criminal investigative arena.\" And so, with that, they said, \"Well, then we’re done.\" And I was in shock. It’s unheard of for a special agent in charge to be denied the opportunity to complete an investigation that was so far from nearing its end. And then— AMY GOODMAN: So you have the EPA considering penalties of upwards of, what, 800—or $672 million, possibly felony charges against BP executives, and they end up settling for $20 million? SCOTT WEST: Yes, they ended up settling for $20 million. And I was told there was a couple of reasons for that $20 million figure. One, we have to go back to the Olympic Pipe Line case. The Olympic pipeline ruptured in Bellingham, Washington in 1999, and the resulting spill of gasoline into a stream caught fire. Three individuals were burned to death, and a stream was destroyed. That case was investigated by EPA out of the Seattle office. In '99 and 2000, it was considered a very significant criminal case in the US attorney's office in Seattle, which was at that time under the Clinton administration. When the Bush administration took over at the Department of Justice, and the US attorney came in, it was—became a bottom-of-the-barrel case and was ultimately settled out for a very low amount of money. And I have been talking with one of the investigators on that case, and he said the amount of money that was determined as the fine in that matched what the insurance companies were willing to pay. So Olympic Pipe Line essentially did not have to actually pay the fine, but it was covered by their insurance company. Now, that Olympic Pipe Line settlement became the benchmark, within the Bush Department of Justice, for environmental crime. \n \n Yeah, that's some accountability Sarah. There are plenty of more than valid reasons to be criticizing what's gone on with this oil spill and the response. Sarah Palin doesn't have an ounce of credibility to be the one making any of them, but that won't stop Fox News from bringing her on as though she does. \n \n h/t aview999 for the Reuters link.",
    "summary": "– Sarah Palin took time out from her war with new neighbor Joe McGinniss—now safely behind a mile-high fence—to launch a Facebook attack on President Obama, who she says passed the buck in his press conference on the Gulf oil spill and hasn't gotten federal agencies involved fast enough. \"His lack of executive experience might explain this because he is apparently unaware that it’s his job as a chief executive to make sure they do their jobs and help solve problems.\" Could be read as a cute rejoinder to Press Secretary Robert Gibbs suggesting sweetly on Sunday that Palin, who had charged that Obama was in bed with BP because of campaign contributions, apparently \"wasn't paying a whole lot of attention\" during the election, and might want to get \"slightly more informed as to what's going on in and around drilling in this country.\" Palin goes on to slam Obama's decision to suspend drilling off the coast of Alaska, and says it shows how much the president has to learn. \"Please learn that we must have domestic energy development, you must stop looking backward and blaming Bush, and we must all work together to 'plug the d#*! hole.' ”"

    "document": "Lindsay Austin and her husband, Lamar, sit with their newborn son, Cainan, on New Year’s Day in Concord. LEAH WILLINGHAM For the Monitor \n \n For the Monitor \n \n Related stories \n \n Four days ago, Lamar Austin became the proud father of the first baby born in Concord, losing his job after missing work to be with his family at the hospital. \n \n He chose to remain positive, he said, focusing on his new son instead of the job he lost. \n \n “Sometimes you lose something and you get something even better,” he said Sunday afternoon while resting at Concord Hospital with his wife, Lindsay, and baby boy, Cainan. \n \n Since then, the military veteran and father of four has received at least three job offers, an outpouring of support and a fundraising page dedicated to helping his family financially. \n \n After reading in the Monitor that Austin was hoping to get into electrical work, Denis Beaudoin, the business manager from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Concord, offered Austin the chance to apply for an apprenticeship. \n \n Beaudoin lives in Pittsfield, the same town as Austin, and said electrical work might offer a more flexible and understanding environment for someone like Austin, who has a big family and wants to devote time to it. \n \n “I know how valuable family time is, and if you’re a union member we incorporate that, we understand that, and we don’t penalize you for that,” Beaudoin said. \n \n Glenn Brackett, president of the NH AFL-CIO union, which represents nearly 30,000 workers, also offered Austin an apprenticeship. \n \n And the branch manager of the Adecco staffing agency in Portsmouth offered to help Austin find another job. \n \n Old job \n \n Austin said he was hired by Salerno Protective Services a month ago for a 90-day trial period as a part-time security guard in which he was expected to be on call 24/7. Salerno Protective Services provides security to clients including stores and college campuses. \n \n When Austin got the job, the company told him they were looking for “dependable people,” he said. \n \n Austin said he couldn’t cover one shift offered to him last month because he had to take his wife to a doctor’s appointment. Then Lindsay went into labor Friday night and Cainan was born Sunday morning. Austin said he missed shifts Friday and Saturday. At 1 a.m. on New Year’s Day, Austin said he got a text that read: “As of now, you are terminated.” \n \n The company said Tuesday it wouldn’t comment on an employee’s status. \n \n “Being shrouded in confidentiality we are unable to comment until all business with Mr. Austin has been concluded,” president and CEO Anthony Salerno said by email Wednesday. “SPS is not in the practice of releasing employees for reasons stated in the article you published but must be cognizant of the product we give our clients!” \n \n Family support \n \n The story struck a chord with readers who questioned whether an employee could be fired for missing work due to the birth of a child. \n \n Because New Hampshire is an “at-will” employment state, an employer may generally terminate an employment relationship for part-time or full-time workers at any time and for any reason, with a few exceptions. That means Austin has little in the way of legal protection, no matter how good an excuse the birth of a child may seem, legal experts said. \n \n Sara Persechino, a mother of two in Hopkinton, doesn’t think that’s fair. Persechino was on the Hopkinton select board in 2014 when it unanimously voted in favor of paid family leave for town employees. \n \n “I don’t think anyone should ever have to choose between their family and their job,” she said. \n \n She decided to set up a GoFundMe account for the Austin family. \n \n “I don’t think they should have to be worrying about financial issues right now; it should be a joyful time for them,” Persechino said. “Anything we can do to make this even more joyous is worth it.” \n \n As for Austin, he said he is surprised and beyond grateful for all the support. \n \n “I’m thanking God for delivering one of the many promises,” he said. \n \n (Leah Willingham can be reached at news@cmonitor.com.) ||||| Lindsay Austin, 26, and her husband, Lamar Austin, 30, sit with their newborn son, Cainan Austin, at Concord Hospital on Jan. 1. Lindsay Austin said she’s thankful for the support her family has received since her story went public. LEAH WILLINGHAM / For the Monitor \n \n For the Monitor \n \n Related stories \n \n Lindsay Austin is grateful for all the support her family has received after her husband was fired early New Year’s Day for missing work to attend the birth of their son. \n \n “I was a little bit upset, because my husband is trying to provide for us and it was hard to swallow when he got fired, but I’m thankful and I feel like we’re blessed,” Austin said Thursday. “It definitely happened for a reason.” \n \n Austin said she hopes other workers won’t have to make the same choice her husband, Lamar, had to make – go to work or lose his job. \n \n “Hopefully, we can be part of the movement,” she said, as new baby Cainan, slept nearby. “Hopefully things can change and a law can be passed so this doesn’t affect other people again in the same way.” \n \n The family’s story – they were featured in Monday’s Monitor after having the first baby of the new year in Concord – caught the public’s eye and struck a chord with many of the state’s legislators and labor leaders. \n \n State Sen. Dan Feltes of Concord said he tried to create protections for employees like Lamar Austin during the last legislative session with Senate Bill 416, which offers workers “flexible working arrangements,” for reasons including the hospitalization of a family member, or the birth of a child. \n \n But it’s not the employer’s job to offer flexible arrangements. It’s up to the employee to ask for flexibility, which isn’t possible in all circumstances. \n \n “Hard-working Granite Staters shouldn’t have to choose between work and family,” Feltes said. \n \n It’s hard to know if SB416 would have worked out for Austin and his former employer Salerno Protective Services. So far, company president Anthony Salerno has declined to say much about Austin or why he was dismissed. \n \n Currently, neither the federal nor state government have a family and medical leave law or program. The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act allows certain workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid – but job-protected – leave to tend to a serious health condition or to care for a new child or an ill relative. \n \n However, there are a few catches in the FMLA: including the size of the employer and how many hours an employee had worked over the course of a year. Austin was hired to work as a part-time security guard for Salerno in December and isn’t covered. \n \n Nationally, about 41 percent of employees are not covered by FMLA, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. \n \n About half of Granite Staters lack access to parental leave, and less than a third of workers have access to all three types of extended leave: for their own illness, for parental leave and for care of a family member, according to a study done by Kristen Smith, a family demographer at the Carsey School of Public Policy. \n \n Family time \n \n If New Hampshire wants to attract and retain young workers – Austin is a 30-year-old Army veteran – it needs to offer maternity and paternity leave, but also types of medical leave including those who may need to miss work to care for an ailing partner, child or parent, said Chris D’Allesandro, New Hampshire Mom Force Director of MomsRising, an advocacy group for mothers and families. \n \n “Key things that millennial workforces are looking for are these kinds of jobs that allow them to divide their time between caring for their families and their professions,” D’Allesandro said. \n \n Glenn Brackett, president of the NH AFL-CIO union, agreed that New Hampshire needs some kind of legal mechanism for citizens to get time off to care for their families. He said that’s especially true of part-time employees like Lamar Austin. \n \n “In New Hampshire, we have a lot of temporary employees and part-time employees that aren’t covered under any federal laws, and these people are being basically taken advantage of,” Brackett said. \n \n Brackett, whose union represents nearly 30,000 workers, challenged the new governor, Chris Sununu, to stand behind legislation change for working families. In his inaugural speech on Thursday, Sununu cited the need for the state to retain and grow a workforce of younger workers. \n \n “If Gov. Sununu really feels that he has to do something to help working people, using this example of Mr. Austin as a stepping-off point, will he be supportive of legislation that would right this wrong?” Brackett queried. \n \n Executive Councilor Andru Volinsky, who was sworn into office Thursday, cited the plight of the Austin family and said fair labor practices will be at the forefront of his mind during the next two years. \n \n “When companies come to the state seeking contracts, I want to know about their employment practices,” he said. “And if they’re similar to that security company, I can tell you they’re going to get a hard time from me because they’re not respectful to their employees.” \n \n Job options \n \n Lamar Austin is now eyeing a shot at a new career as an electrician – or one of the multiple job opportunities that poured in after people read his story. \n \n Austin was offered the opportunity to apply for an electrician’s apprenticeship with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Concord, along with a host of other jobs. \n \n “Anything that would be more stable, and allow me to spend time with my family is a blessing,” Lamar Austin said. \n \n Of course, the job is no handout, said Denis Beaudoin, the IBEW business manager. \n \n “We’re giving him the potential hand-up, if you will, by offering him a career in the electrical construction field as an apprentice,” Beaudoin said. \n \n Beaudoin said a first-year apprentice can make around $28,000 a year, plus benefits. If Austin gets the electrician job, he said it will be the best-paid job he’s ever had. \n \n As for all the support, it’s been overwhelming, the Austins said. A GoFundMe account created by Sara Persechino, a mother of two from Hopkinton, already exceeded the account’s goal of $1,000 in one day. \n \n “I didn’t expect this at all,” Lamar Austin said. “I don’t really watch the news or TV, so when I started getting all these emails from people wanting to help, it was a lot to take in.” \n \n Austin said he’s been in contact with Salerno Protective Services to pick up his last check, hand in his uniform and talk about what happened. He said that, in his mind, there’s no bad blood between them – he understands why Salerno did what he did. \n \n “It wasn’t a clash of who’s the bigger man,” Austin said. “He had his company, which is like his baby, and I had my baby, which was just being born. Naturally, he’s going to pick his baby over my baby. I can’t blame him for that.” \n \n (Leah Willingham can be reached at news@cmonitor.com.) ||||| Lindsay Austin, 26, and her husband, Lamar Austin, 30, sit with their newborn son, Cainan, in their room at Concord Hospital on Sunday. Cainan was the first baby born in Concord in 2017. LEAH WILLINGHAM / Monitor staff \n \n For the Monitor \n \n Related stories \n \n Lamar Austin was faced with a difficult decision on New Year’s Eve. \n \n His nine-months-pregnant wife, Lindsay, was in her second day of early labor, but his boss was telling him if he didn’t show up for his shift as a part-time security guard in Manchester, he would lose his job. \n \n Austin weighed his options, and concluded that no matter the consequences, he wasn’t going to miss his son’s birth. \n \n “I thought, ‘Family comes before anything else,’ ” Austin said. “I’m not going to turn my back on them for a job.” \n \n So, at 4 a.m. on the first day of the year, Austin, 30, drove his 26-year-old wife, Lindsay Austin, to Concord Hospital from their home in Pittsfield. He had to be careful on the roads, which were still icy from the snowstorm of the day before. \n \n After what the couple said felt like four short hours later, their son, Cainan Austin, was born. He arrived at 7:44 a.m. – the first baby of the year in Concord. And, most importantly, Cainan’s father was there to hold him after his birth. \n \n Later in the afternoon, while resting at the hospital with his wife and newborn, Austin said he felt at peace with the decision to miss work. However, he admitted it hadn’t been easy. Right before he drove his wife to the hospital, his boss sent him a text saying that he was officially terminated. \n \n “It was hard, but if I have to choose between work and family, I’m always going to pick my family,” he said, gently patting his son’s pink-and-blue striped hat as he slept in his mother’s arms. “Sometimes you lose something, and you get something even better.” \n \n The couple chose the name Cainan for their son because they thought it was unusual – and both liked it right away when they heard it. When he was born, Cainan was 7 pounds, 3 ounces and 19 inches. His mother noted how similar he looks to her other three children – 8, 3 and 21 months. \n \n Lindsay was surprised that Cainan was born on his expected due date – Jan. 1. \n \n “We were laughing about having the first baby of the year,” she said. “We never thought it would actually happen.” \n \n Lindsay is a stay-at-home-mom, and she said it’s the best job there is. \n \n “I’m so lucky to be able to do that,” she said. \n \n The couple met almost 10 years ago on an online dating site, and later had their first daughter, now 8. But Lamar, who was originally from New Jersey and an ammunition specialist in the Army, wasn’t able to move to New Hampshire where Lindsay lived until four years ago. \n \n In 2012, Lamar arrived in the Granite State hoping to spend more time with his daughter, but he wasn’t able to find housing or a job right away. He lived temporarily at the McKenna House in Concord, while Lindsay stayed with her mother in Manchester. \n \n Despite some ups and downs, Lindsay and Lamar decided to get married this past year and set up their home. \n \n Lindsay’s mom was watching the couple’s other three children while they were in the hospital Sunday. Lindsay and Lamar video-chatted Lindsay’s mom from their hospital room, and she reported that Cainan’s brothers and sisters are very excited to meet the family’s newest member. \n \n Lindsay and Lamar said they had always wanted a big family. \n \n “We always used to joke about having 10 kids when we first got together, but I think we’re going to be taking a break for a while after this one,” Lindsay said, smiling. \n \n As for 2017, Lindsay said she just hopes the family stays happy and healthy. Lamar said he wants to focus on spending as much time together as they can. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

    "summary": "– A month ago, Lamar Austin was hired by a security company for a 90-day trial period that involved him being on call 24/7. On New Year's Day, Austin's son was born. Austin, who had already had to miss one shift offered to him due to a doctor's appointment for his wife, ended up missing shifts on Friday and Saturday. Son Cainan was born Sunday, and at 1am that day, Austin got a text notifying him he'd been terminated from Salerno Protective Services. Austin's story made headlines, especially due to the fact that Cainan was the first baby born in Concord, NH, in 2017. \"If I have to choose between work and family, I’m always going to pick my family,\" Austin told the Monitor shortly after his son's birth. Since then, people have been stepping up to help Austin, a 30-year-old military veteran and father of four, big-time. He's gotten offers for at least three jobs, plus money raised for him on a GoFundMe page set up by a mother who was upset by what happened to Austin—even though, as experts explain to the Concord Monitor, it's perfectly legal in an \"at-will\" employment state such as New Hampshire. In a statement reported by WCVB, Anthony Salerno Jr. cited confidentiality in not commenting on the particulars of the situation, but did say \"SPS is not in the practice of releasing employees for reasons stated in the article published in the monitor [sic] but must be cognizant of the product we give our clients!\" But there's no bad blood, Austin tells the Monitor. \"[Salerno] had his company, which is like his baby, and I had my baby ... Naturally, he’s going to pick his baby over my baby. I can't blame him for that.\" (This waitress lost her job for firing a shot at robbers.)"

    "document": "Back in October, I wrote about Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) and his praise-worthy amendment to the FY 2010 Defense appropriations bill that would bar the government from contracting with companies who prevent their employees from bringing workplace sexual assault cases to court. The amendment passed easily 68 to 30 – with the thirty senators who voted against the measure receiving a good amount of backlash – but shortly after the vote there were rumors that conferees would strip the amendment from the final bill during reconciliation with the House. Not to fear, though, because according to Sam Stein over at the Huffington Post, the Franken amendment survived, and the final language is \"remarkably strong.\" \n \n An aide to Franken told Stein \"the substance of the language 'is unchanged,'\" which means the government will not be able to contract with companies that restrict employees from going to court over charges of \"assault, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress or negligent hiring practice[s].\" Moreover, the Title VII provision of the amendment, which allows an employee to sue not only the alleged perpetrator but also the perpetrator's employer, remains in the bill as well. The amendment applies to all contracts totaling $1million or more. \n \n There is a small loophole in the amendment, but it will be hard for contractors to get through it: \n \n The Franken amendment includes a national security waiver, meaning that the Department of Defense could prevent a case from coming to court if it imperils safety measures. But, for that to happen, the Secretary of Defense would have to \"personally explain why the waiver was used to Congress and at that point make it public,\" the Franken aide explained. \n \n This solid amendment will prevent contractors from carrying out what were some of the most despicable business practices I think a company could foist on a person. \n \n Image by Flickr user Aaron Landry used under a Creative Commons license. ||||| ​ \n \n \"In 2008, she was transferred to Texas and worked as an administrative associate in the dispatch office at the Alvarado Camp.

Her case caused Al Franken to sponsor a defense bill amendment stipulating that defense contractors can't force people not to sue them if they get raped on the job. Kelly also represents several other women with sexual assault and/or harassment cases against KBR and Halliburton.Kelly tells Unfair Park that Halliburton is a less-than-ideal place to work for women: \"I don't believe that Halliburton treats its women as they should.\" He says Darden told her supervisors she was pregnant even though she \"had already been told by co-workers that she would be fired if she reported her pregnancy.\" According to Kelly, that was the general office scuttlebutt:. In court documents, Darden says she first told her supervisor of her pregnancy in March 2009 and was told on June 3, 2009, that she was losing her job as part of a general lay-off, but Darden says she was the only person let go at the time:For a brief time, Kelly says Unfair Park, his client's job was even advertised on the Internet after she was laid off, though he says Halliburton \"took it off pretty quickly.\" Darden is seeking damages for back pay and \"front pay in lieu of reinstatement, which would not be feasible under the circumstances.\"Read Darden's complaint in full below.",

    "document": "Days after student reporters at Pittsburg High School in Kansas dug into the background of their newly hired principal and found questionable credentials, she resigned from the $93,000-a-year job. \n \n “She was going to be the head of our school, and we wanted be assured that she was qualified and had the proper credentials,” said Trina Paul, a senior and an editor of the Booster Redux, the school newspaper. “We stumbled on some things that most might not consider legitimate credentials.” \n \n Minutes into a closed special meeting Tuesday night of the Pittsburg Community Schools Board of Education, board president Al Mendez emerged to announce to a packed boardroom that Amy Robertson, the new principal, had resigned. \n \n “In light of the issues that arose, Amy Robertson felt it was in the best interest of the district to resign her position,” Superintendent Destry Brown said in a statement after the executive session. \n \n Premium content for only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. SUBSCRIBE NOW \n \n The board agreed with that decision and said will reopen the principal position Wednesday morning and contact others who had applied for the job to see if they are still interested. \n \n “Our goal is to find the best person to be our principal that we can find,” Brown said. “I know the students want that too.” \n \n Pittsburg journalism adviser Emily Smith said she is “very proud” of her students. “They were not out to get anyone to resign or to get anyone fired. They worked very hard to uncover the truth.” \n \n Students journalists published a story Friday questioning the legitimacy of the private college — Corllins University — where Robertson got her master’s and doctorate degrees years ago. U.S. Department of Education officials, contacted by The Star, confirmed student reports; the federal agency could not find evidence of Corllins in operation. The school wasn’t included among the agency’s list of schools closed since 1986. Robertson earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Tulsa. \n \n Students found and The Star confirmed the existence of several articles referring to Corllins as a diploma mill — where people can buy a degree, diploma or certificates. And searches on the school’s website go nowhere. No one from the university responded to emails sent by The Star this week. \n \n Contacted by email Friday, Robertson, who has lived off and on for 19 years in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, said, “The current status of Corllins University is not relevant because when I received my MA in 1994 and my PhD in 2010, there was no issue.” \n \n She also said, “All three of my degrees have been authenticated by the US government.” Robertson declined to comment directly on students’ questions about her credentials, saying, “I have no comment in response to the questions posed by PHS students regarding my credentials because their concerns are not based on facts.” \n \n The Pittsburg Board of Education approved hiring Robertson at its meeting March 6. \n \n In a news release about the hiring, district spokesman Zach Fletcher said that “Robertson comes to Pittsburg with decades of experience in education.” \n \n Robertson is CEO of Atticus I S Consultants, “an education consulting firm where she gained leadership and management experience at the international equivalence of a building administrator and superintendent,” the release said. \n \n Robertson, after application reviews and interviews with administrators, faculty and students, “emerged as the best fit” for the job, said Brown. He said the district relies on the Kansas Department of Education to approve a candidate’s credentials. \n \n “I felt like she is very knowledgeable about what is going on in education today in college and career readiness, she is very familiar with Common Core, she knows about how a building works and about maintaining a safe environment,” he said. \n \n He was surprised students questioned Robertson’s credentials. \n \n “The kids had never gone through someone like this before,” Brown said. But he said he encouraged them to seek answers. “I want our kids to have real-life experiences, whether it’s welding or journalism.” \n \n Despite questions, Brown said Friday that the district’s school board had “100 percent supported the Robertson hire.” \n \n Tuesday night he said he felt bad about how it all turned out. “ I do feel it is my responsibility. As superintendent I feel like I let the teachers and the students down. I publicly admit that.” \n \n Robertson, who he said also has a teaching degree from the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England, isn’t licensed in Kansas. She would have had to take classes at Pittsburg State University, pass a test and acquire her license before she could officially hold the principal post. That isn’t uncommon for someone hired from outside the state, Brown said. \n \n Maddie Baden, a 17-year-old Pittsburg High junior, said the student news staff began looking into Robertson’s background after an electronic search of her name turned up several articles published by Gulf News about an English language school connected to Robertson in Dubai. \n \n The 2012 articles said Dubai’s education authority had suspended the license for Dubai American Scientific School and accused Robertson of not being authorized to serve as principal of that school. The private, for-profit school received an “unsatisfactory” rating on Dubai education authority inspection reports every year from 2008 to 2012 and was closed in September 2013. \n \n “That raised a red flag,” Baden said. “If students could uncover all of this, I want to know why the adults couldn’t find this..” \n \n She had originally interviewed Robertson for a routine school newspaper story “to introduce the new principal to the community,” Baden said. “No one knew who she was.” \n \n Pittsburg is about 90 minutes south of Kansas City on U.S. 69. The high school has 900 students. \n \n Six students worked about three weeks looking into Robertson’s past work and education. \n \n When they went to Corllins University’s website, “We found a website that didn’t work,” Baden said. And a student checking with the Council for Higher Education Accreditation found that Corllins was not listed in its database of 7,600 schools accredited by a recognized accrediting agency in the United States. \n \n But officials there told The Star the school could have been accredited in the past. ||||| High school journalists in Kansas investigated their principal and found discrepancies in her credentials, prompting her to resign. Professional journalists like The Post's David Fahrenthold congratulated the kids for asking tough questions. (Monica Akhtar,Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n Connor Balthazor, 17, was in the middle of study hall when he was called into a meeting with his high school newspaper adviser. \n \n A group of reporters and editors from the student newspaper, the Booster Redux at Pittsburg High School in southeastern Kansas, had gathered to talk about Amy Robertson, who was hired as the high school’s head principal on March 6. \n \n The student journalists had begun researching Robertson, and quickly found some discrepancies in her education credentials. For one, when they researched Corllins University, the private university where Robertson said she got her master’s and doctorate degrees years ago, the website didn’t work. They found no evidence that it was an accredited university. \n \n “There were some things that just didn’t quite add up,” Balthazor told The Washington Post. \n \n The students began digging into a weeks-long investigation that would result in an article published Friday questioning the legitimacy of the principal’s degrees and of her work as an education consultant. \n \n On Tuesday night, Robertson resigned. \n \n “In light of the issues that arose, Dr. Robertson felt it was in the best interest of the district to resign her position,” Pittsburg Community Schools announced in a statement. “The Board has agreed to accept her resignation.” \n \n The resignation thrust the student newspaper staff into local, state and national news, with professional journalists nationwide applauding the students for asking tough questions and prompting change in their administration. \n \n “Everybody kept telling them, ‘stop poking your nose where it doesn’t belong,'” newspaper adviser Emily Smith told The Post. But with the encouragement of the superintendent, the students persisted. \n \n “They were at a loss that something that was so easy for them to see was waiting to be noticed by adults,” Smith said. \n \n In the Booster Redux article, a team of six students — five juniors and one senior — revealed that Corllins had been portrayed in a number of articles as a diploma mill, a place where people can buy a degree, diploma or certificates. Corllins is not accredited by the U.S. Department of Education, the students reported. The Better Business Bureau’s website says Corllins’s physical address is unknown and the school isn’t a BBB-accredited institution. \n \n “All of this was completely overlooked,” Balthazor said. “All of the shining reviews did not have these crucial pieces of information … you would expect your authority figures to find this.” \n \n Robertson had been living in Dubai for more than 20 years before she was hired for the position. She said she most recently worked as the chief executive of an education consulting firm known as Atticus I S Consultants there. \n \n In a conference call with the student journalists, Robertson “presented incomplete answers, conflicting dates and inconsistencies in her responses,” the students reported. She said she attended Corllins before it lost accreditation, the Booster Redux reported. \n \n When contacted by the Kansas City Star after the publication of the students’ article, Robertson said all three of her degrees “have been authenticated by the U.S. government.” She declined to comment directly on students’ questions about her credentials, “because their concerns are not based on facts,” she said. \n \n In an emergency faculty meeting Tuesday, the superintendent said Robertson was unable to produce a transcript confirming her undergraduate degree from the University of Tulsa, Smith said. \n \n During the course of their reporting, the students spent weeks reaching out to educational institutions and accreditation agencies to corroborate Robertson’s background, some even working through spring break. Their adviser, Smith, had to recuse herself from the story because she was on the committee that hired Robertson. So the students sought the help of Eric Thomas, executive director of the Kansas Scholastic Press Association, and other local and national journalists and experts. \n \n Under Kansas law, high school journalists are protected from administrative censorship. “The kids are treated as professionals,” Smith said. But with that freedom came a major responsibility to get the story right, Smith said. It also meant overcoming a natural hesitancy many students have to question authority. \n \n “At the very beginning it was a little bit exciting,” Balthazor said. “It was like in the movies, a big city journalist chasing down a lead.” \n \n But as the students began delving deeper into the story, keeping notes on a whiteboard, “it really started hitting me that this is a much bigger deal,” Balthazor said. \n \n The students were among those packed into a school boardroom Tuesday night when the school board president announced Robertson’s resignation. After the announcement, a parent in the audience stood up and asked school officials if they would be recognizing the student journalists for uncovering crucial details about Robertson’s background. The superintendent said he would be meeting with the students Wednesday to personally thank them. \n \n “We’d broken out of our comfort zones so much,” Balthazor said. “To know that the administration saw that and respected that, it was a really great moment for us.” \n \n After local news broke that Robertson had resigned, numerous national journalists — including The Post’s David Fahrenthold — tweeted the students’ story, congratulating them for their work. \n \n “Holy crap,” Balthazor thought, “why are these people paying attention to this little journalism story from southeast Kansas?” \n \n While the high school junior was leaving track practice Tuesday night, he learned in a group message with his newspaper staff that Todd Wallack, a reporter for the Boston Globe’s Spotlight Team, had tweeted the students’ story, saying: “Great investigative work by high school journalists.” Balthazor sat in his car in the parking lot and immediately called his mom to tell her the news. \n \n “I honestly thought they were joking at first,” Balthazor said. The Booster Redux staff had watched the movie “Spotlight” in class last year, Balthazor said. “It was awesome to know that such respected members of the journalism community had our backs.” \n \n After graduation, Balthazor said, he hopes to pursue a degree in creative writing or filmmaking. Even though he doesn’t necessarily plan to stick with journalism, Balthazor said the past few weeks had been “surreal.” \n \n “Most high schoolers would never get even close to an opportunity to get to experience something like this,” he said. \n \n Read more from Morning Mix: \n \n A teen asked his grandmother to her first prom.

    "summary": "– The hiring committee at Pittsburg High School took Amy Robertson's list of credentials—including supposed master’s and doctorate degrees—at face value. But not the school's students, whose investigation has since led to their new principal's resignation. After Robertson was hired for the job at the Kansas school last month, with an annual salary of $93,000, six student journalists writing for the school's Booster Redux newspaper began to dig into her past—only to find things \"just didn’t quite add up,\" one student tells the Washington Post. For example, Corllins University, where Robertson claimed to have been educated, was accused of selling degrees, had no known physical address, and wasn't accredited by the Department of Education. Robertson told the students she attended Corllins before it lost accreditation, but she also \"presented incomplete answers, conflicting dates, and inconsistencies in her responses,\" the Redux reported. Robertson, who has lived in Dubai for the last two decades, told the Kansas City Star last week that she wouldn't comment on her credentials because the students' \"concerns are not based on facts.\" It was \"red flags\" about her time in Dubai that turned up during an electronic search of her name that prompted the students' full investigation; initially, one of the student journalists was planning to write a standard article introducing the students to their new principal. Ultimately, Robertson resigned Tuesday after she was unable to verify an undergraduate degree she said she received from the University of Tulsa, a Redux adviser tells the Post. The students are getting plenty of praise for their investigative work from professional journalists. The school superintendent, meanwhile, says it was up to the school board to review Robertson's credentials before approving the hire, which it did."

Greg Hurlbut.Hurlbut added that police found filthy conditions in the home shared by Rogers and Allen.\"Officers located unsafe and unsanitary living conditions including garbage and spoiled food on the floor, animal and human feces and a large amount of debris making areas of the house unpassable,\" he said.Sharon Henry, chief deputy district attorney for Solano County, said she was \"horrified\" by the statements from the children.She said at a news conference that \"torture occurred in this house\" and it was carried out \"for sadistic purposes.\" She declined to elaborate.\"It literally breaks your heart, and you're outraged by how a parent or anyone could commit those acts,\" Henry said afterward.Rogers says she got pregnant when she was 16 years old. The Fairfield resident went on to say that she has 11 biological children ages four months to 14 years old. Three she had before meeting Allen and eight more in the past 10 years.She says she home schools the children, while working full-time as a medical technician. \"Not only do I have 11 children and I'm 30 years old, but I also homeschool all of my children and people don't agree with that lifestyle and so I've had many people question my right to parent and I just feel like this whole situation was exploded,\" Rogers said.Allen was arraigned Monday afternoon in a Solano County court. He is being held on $5.2 million bail.The children have all been placed in the custody of Rogers' sister and mother in the Bay Area. All 10 children were initially taken into protective custody by Solano County Child Welfare Services.With the assistance of Child Welfare Services and the Solano County District Attorney's Office, detectives with the Fairfield Police Department's Family Violence Unit initiated an investigation.Officials say the investigation revealed a long and continuous history of severe physical and emotional abuse of the children.

    "document": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — Suspected kidnapper and murderer Ariel Castro was indicted again today on hundreds of new criminal charges, but without Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty calling for the death penalty. \n \n The 977-count indictment (read the full text of the charges in the document viewer below) adds charges for crimes that prosecutors contend Castro committed against Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight toward the end of a decade-long imprisonment in Castro's Seymour Avenue home. \n \n A previous 329-count indictment only extended from August 2002, the year prosecutors claim Knight was abducted, until February 2007. \n \n Prosecutors have accused Castro, 52, of kidnapping the women and raping them repeatedly in his home, where he sometimes kept them chained and rarely allowed them to leave the house. \n \n The new indictment includes 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 counts of rape, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, six counts of felonious assault, three counts of child endangerment and one count of possessing criminal tools. \n \n It also includes two counts of aggravated murder, which were among those charges carried over from the previous indictment, stemming from claims that Castro beat and tortured one of the women into miscarrying a child. \n \n \"Today's indictment moves us closer to resolution of this gruesome case,\" McGinty stated in a written release. \"Our investigation continues, as does our preparation for trial.\" \n \n Under Ohio law, McGinty can seek the death penalty for aggravated murder if it is coupled with a kidnapping charge. In 1996, the Ohio legislature passed a law that allows for an aggravated murder charge in cases where a pregnancy is unlawfully terminated. \n \n A capital review committee within McGinty's office met Thursday to discuss whether to pursue the death penalty against Castro. While such a specification is not included in today's indictment, prosecutors could seek to add it later, McGinty spokesman Joe Frolik said. \n \n Castro's attorneys Craig Weintraub and Jaye Schlachet issued a written statement expressing pleasure \"that we were able to convince the prosecutor's office to not seek and obtain the death penalty in this new indictment.\" \n \n They stated further, \"It is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution of this matter so that the women do not have to endure additional trauma.\" \n \n Weintraub elaborated during a phone interview that he and Schlachet submitted mitigating material to the capital review committee that, among other things, raised concerns about subjecting the three women to a trial and disclosing \"the private nature of what occurred.\" \n \n Weintraub has said some of the charges against Castro cannot be refuted and that if the death penalty is not sought, a plea deal could be worked out. \n \n The prosecutor's office stated today that the capital review committee has not completed its evaluation. \n \n Death penalty experts believe McGinty would have a difficult time convincing a jury to sentence Castro to death for various reasons, including the ongoing debate over when life begins and whether killing a fetus is tantamount to murder. \n \n They also believe proving aggravated murder may be difficult without sufficient physical evidence to support testimony from the women. \n \n Another obstacle for McGinty could be the willingness of the three women to take the stand and expose themselves to potentially harsh cross-examination by Castro's defense lawyers, who are duty bound to represent their client to the fullest extent. \n \n \"Do these young women want to testify? Can they testify,\" Case Western Reserve University senior law instructor Michael Benza asked rhetorically during a recent interview. \n \n Included in the evidence collected by the FBI is a diary that was kept by one of the women. \n \n Rob Glickman, a former judge and assistant prosecutor in Cuyahoga County, said McGinty and his advisers likely made their decision not to seek the death penalty based on the strength of the facts in the case and the willingness of the victims to go to trial. \n \n \"I'm sure they made that decision in consultation with the victims,\" he said. \n \n Glickman said that given the extent of the charges against Castro, McGinty should have no problem convincing a judge to give Castro enough consecutive sentences for his crimes to keep him in prison for the rest of his life. \n \n A judge could also impose life without parole if prosecutors are able to prove aggravated murder, said Steve Dever, a former assistant county prosecutor under three previous administrations. \n \n Dever said it's not overkill to charge Castro with so many counts because it's McGinty's obligation to give the court a full accounting of what happened. \n \n \"This is a crime that spanned over a considerable period of time,\" he said. \n \n As for the multiple kidnapping counts, Dever said, a prosecutor can make such a charge in connection with an individual criminal act, such as a rape, that required the restraint of one's liberty to carry out. \n \n Barry, DeJesus and Knight emerged from a decade of captivity on May 4 after Berry, with the help of neighbors, escaped with her 6-year-old daughter through the front door of Castro's home while he was away. \n \n Police responded to find DeJesus and Knight also in the house. All three had gone missing in the same area of west Cleveland about a decade ago and were largely presumed dead. \n \n Their seemingly miraculous rescue captivated the world, and national media outlets are still angling for what they hope is the first interview with the traumatized women. \n \n The women recently released a short youtube video during which they thanked supporters and conveyed an image of recovery. \n \n A fund set up on behalf of the women has received more than $1 million from 9,200 donors, with some of the money already being provided to the women and their families. \n \n Bruce Hennes, a spokesman for the women, declined to comment on today's news. \n \n Castro, who is being held in Cuyahoga County Jail, has appeared in court for pre-trial hearings, always with shackles on his wrists and ankles and with his head bowed. \n \n Judge Michael Russo recently ruled that Casto was competent to stand trial, based on a court-ordered evaluation and a stipulation by Castro's attorneys. \n \n Knight was 21 when she went missing in August of 2002. Berry was 16 when she disappeared in April 2003, while DeJesus was 14 when she failed to arrive home from Wilbur Wright school in April 2004. \n \n The trial is still scheduled to begin Aug. 5. \n \n \n \n ||||| A grand jury has issued a fresh indictment charging Ariel Castro with 977 counts relating to allegations that he held three women captive for about a decade in his Cleveland home, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office said Friday. \n \n The new indictment -- which adds 648 counts to the 329 on which he was indicted last month -- encompasses all the years of the women's captivity, whereas the previous indictment covered only the first four and a half years, the prosecutor's office said. \n \n Authorities said Castro abducted Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Georgina \"Gina\" DeJesus separately in a two-year period starting in 2002. \n \n The women, as well as Berry's 6-year-old daughter, who authorities say was fathered by Castro, were freed in May after one of the women shouted for help while Castro was away from his 1,400-square-foot home. \n \n Among the charges are two counts of aggravated murder, in which Castro is accused of intentionally causing the termination of a pregnancy. \n \n JUST WATCHED Cleveland kidnap victims: Thank you Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cleveland kidnap victims: Thank you 01:50 \n \n Castro also faces 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 counts of rape, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, six counts of felonious assault, three counts of child endangerment and one count of possessing criminal tools. \n \n He will be arraigned July 17.",
    "summary": "– Accused kidnapper Ariel Castro has had 648 new counts added to his indictment, bringing the grand total to 977. To break it down, the entire indictment is 576 pages, and includes: 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 counts of rape, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, six counts of felonious assault, three counts of child endangerment, two counts of aggravated murder (he is accused of unlawfully terminating the pregnancy of one of his captives), and one count of possessing criminal tools, the AP reports. The reason for all the new charges is that his previous indictment only covered the first four-and-a-half years that the three women were allegedly imprisoned in his house. The new indictment covers the entire period, reports CNN. Despite the added heft to the charges, prosecutors are still not seeking the death penalty—though the aggravated murder charges plus the kidnapping charges would allow them to under Ohio law, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports. A spokesperson for the County Prosecutor says they still may. But by not seeking the death penalty, a plea deal could be worked out, which would spare the three women the emotional turmoil of going through a trial."

Rogers and other passengers took turns giving her CPR. \n \n “We just kept doing (CPR), maybe 25 minutes . . . we just kept going. Somebody helped carry her toward the back of the train – that was before the fire fighters arrived.” \n \n Rogers said it took about 40 minutes before firefighters arrived and began evacuating the train. Passengers walked through the tunnel back to L’Enfant station. He said the air in the tunnel was easier to breathe than the air on the train. On the train, he said the smoked had a chemical smell, but in the tunnel it had the distinct smell of burning wood. Once they got to L’Enfant he saw a lot of ambulances and fire trucks. \n \n Rogers, who works for the D.C. Department of Transportation, took a Capital BikeShare bike back to his office near the Navy Yard. Normally, he would have taken BikeShare back to his office, but opted to take Metro because it was raining. And then, he’d gotten aboard the Yellow Line by mistake. He meant to catch a Green Line train. \n \n “The only scary part was not knowing if the smoke was going to stop,” he said. \n \n Adjoa Adofo, 30, had just gotten off work as a public relations consultant and was on the Yellow line headed to Virginia to go shopping. \n \n A few minutes after pulling out of the station and into the tunnel, she said the train came to an abrupt halt and smoke came in thorough the closed doors. She said the train was crowded but not packed, with room in the center aisle \n \n “People were panicking,” said Adofo, who lives nearNavy Yard. “We didn’t know what to do and and we weren’t getting a lot of information.” \n \n She said the train operator told them there was no fire, just smoke. “That calmed people down a little bit ,” she said. “But smoke continued to come in. The driver told us not to open the doors. That was the big thing. More smoke would come in. But people were panicking. They were trying up open the doors anyway.” \n \n She said people sat down on the floor to get away from the smoke. She said all the lights were out. “It was black. Pitch black.” She said one young man suffered a seizure and an older man began banging on the doors screaming profanities. \n \n She said they were there about 30 to 40 minutes. She said the operator told them they were waiting for a train in the station to move so they could return but communication had broken down. Finally she said metro personnel and firefighters got everyone out and they marched single fine back to the station. \n \n Adofo emerged nearly in tears and said she prayed — Hail Marys and Our Fathers. “I’m just glad that I’m out of there.” \n \n Saleh Damiger and Sirwan Kajjo said they thought they were “going to die” when they Yellow Line train they were on Monday afternoon filled with smoke. \n \n Damiger, 43, and Kajjo, 28, both Voice of America employees, got on a Yellow Line train headed toward the Pentagon about 3 p.m. They said the six-car train had gone about 200 feet when it stopped. The train operator said “there’s a problem, nobody move”. The men said the car quickly began to fill will smoke. \n \n “The train stopped and all of a sudden it filled with smoke. … There was no fire. Lots of smoke only. … People were choking. People were yelling, Damiger said. “It was a lot of smoke. We couldn’t see each other. … One woman, she started to pray. .. We felt like we were almost going to die.” \n \n Metro employees quickly got onto the train and told passengers to get low to the ground to avoid the smoke. \n \n “They told us to get down, get down in the floor, stay low … Of course it was dark too,” Kajjo said. “The lights were gone. We couldn’t see.” \n \n The men said they saw at least two people who appeared to be unconscious. They said they waited about an hour before firefighters arrived and began escorting them off the train and led them out of the tunnel. \n \n They described the experienced as “harrowing”. \n \n \n \n Metro train riders are seen being shuttled on a Metrobus after commuters were evacuated from the L’Enfant Metro Station when smoke filled a Metro car on Wednesday. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \n \n No cause of the smoke has been determined. Around 5:40 p.m., Metro spokeswoman Caroline Laurin said that the smoke has now cleared from the station. That is at least in part due to the tunnel fans that Metro workers turned on, she said. But in the event that the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction – which workers have not yet confirmed – the smoke may also have abated because Metro shut down the third rail at L’Enfant Plaza. \n \n As of 5:40 p.m., Green/Yellow line service has been restored at Gallery Place Station for service to/from stations north (toward Greenbelt). Green/Yellow service remains suspended between Gallery Place and Navy Yard/Pentagon. \n \n Yellow Line riders traveling between Virginia and DC should use the Blue Line as an alternate. \n \n Andrew Ames, spokesman for the FBI’s Washington Field Office, said the FBI responded to the incident.

Hundreds of people were evacuated from L'Enfant Plaza station—one of the Metro network's busiest—and from a Yellow Line train that was stuck in a tunnel, the Washington Post reports. At least two of the injured are in critical condition, and officials say the name of the woman who died will not be released until next of kin have been notified. The NTSB's investigator in charge says the cause appears to have been an \"arcing event\" in which electricity jumped from the system's third rail, reports the New York Times. Water in the tunnel may have been a contributing factor, he says. Passengers who were on the stuck train described scenes of panic as the smoke grew thicker before firefighters arrived to help them escape by walking through the tunnel back to the station. \"We couldn't see anything. The visibility was poor,\" a passenger waiting to be taken to a hospital told NBC. \"Everybody got as low as they possibly could to the ground, because that's where the best possibility for oxygen was.\" One firefighter is among the injured.

The researchers looked at the bacteria's gene expression, hoping to figure out why Propionibacterium acnes, which is the most common skin microbe, causes pimples in some people but not in others. \n \n They found that vitamin B12 changed the gene expression of the skin bacteria, which could have led to acne-promoting inflammation. \n \n In humans, vitamin B12 plays roles in metabolism, red blood cell formation and the maintenance of the central nervous system. It's commonly found in multivitamins, but the new research could raise questions about whether people with acne should take vitamin B12 supplements. \n \n \"I think there's a link\" between vitamin B12 and acne, said Huiying Li, a co-author of the new study and an assistant professor of pharmacology at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine. Her team found a molecular pathway that could explain the link in their study, but it will need to be confirmed by future research.\"There's still a lot to be studied in order to really understand if B12 causes acne,\" she said. \n \n Looking for a mechanism \n \n By looking at the gene expression patterns, Li's team first found that the pathway that produces vitamin B12 was significantly altered in the skin bacteria of people with acne, compared with the skin bacteria of people without acne. This finding raised Li's suspicions about B12's role in acne, she said. Prior studies citing an association between these two elements confirmed the possibility of a link — research dating back to the 1950s has suggested that vitamin B12 supplements could contribute to some people's acne. \n \n Li's research team then looked at the skin bacterium in pimple-free people who received a vitamin B12 injection. The researchers confirmed that the B12 supplement repressed the expression of genes in P. acnes involved in synthesizing the vitamin. In fact, the expression of those genes was lowered to levels similar to those of acne patients. [4 Common Skin Woes, and How to Fix Them] \n \n A week after receiving the vitamin B12 injection, one of the 10 participants broke out in pimples. That person's P. acnes gene-expression pattern also changed, the researchers found. Before the B12 injection, it was similar to those of the other healthy participants, but 14 days after the vitamin B12 shot, it looked much more like an acne patient's pattern. \n \n The researchers also did experiments on P. acnes growing in lab dishes.They found that when they added vitamin B12 to the bacteria, the microbes started producing compounds called porphyrins, which promote inflammation in acne. Inflammation is a key step in the later stages of acne development, Li said. \n \n Together, the new findings suggest that when too much B12 is present, the bacteria have changes in their gene expression that suppress further synthesis of the vitamin. These bacteria switch to producing porphyrins, the researchers explained, and in some people, this uptick in inflammatory compounds may contribute to acne. \n \n \"We think the pathway we studied could potentially explain part of acne's pathogenesis,\" Li said. \n \n Hang on to those vitamins \n \n But although the study found a possible link, it did not prove that too much vitamin B12 definitely causes or worsens acne. \n \n \"The data and hypothesis are very intriguing, but much additional investigation is required to determine if this is a real cause-and-effect phenomenon,\" said Josh Miller, a professor of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University who was not involved with the study. \n \n In addition, although the new findings suggest that B12 supplements may promote inflammation, other studies have suggested the opposite — that vitamin B12 has anti-inflammatory properties, Miller said. \n \n \"Proof of a causative effect of B12 supplements on acne development will require randomized control trials with enough subjects to see a significant effect, if one exists,\" he told Live Science. \n \n Li also cautioned that it's way too early to suggest that people dealing with acne should stop taking multivitamins with B12. Most of the studies that have found an increase in acne with vitamin B12 involved large doses of the vitamin, given by injections, she pointed out. \n \n \"This study does present some compelling evidence suggesting that supplementation with B12 can cause or exacerbate acne in a subset of individuals,\" said Dr. Whitney Bowe, clinical assistant professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. \"However, we don't have enough evidence at this point to broadly recommend that all acne patients try to avoid vitamin B12 supplements or foods rich in vitamin B12.\" \n \n Beyond zits \n \n The aim of the research was to better understand how humans, and the microbes that live on their bodies, interact to cause disease, Li said. A deeper understanding of microbial-disease pathways could lead to more targeted treatments, the researchers wrote in their study, published today (June 24) in the journal Science Translational Medicine. \n \n \"The study shows that \"what we eat or drink can impact the health of our skin by affecting the microbes that live on our skin,\" Bowe said. \"We have 10 bacterial cells for every one human cell in our body. The more we learn about these bacteria, the more we are realizing the major impact they have on our health and well-being.\" \n \n Follow Jennifer Abbasi on Twitter.

Vitamin B12 alters how the genes of facial bacteria behave — a change that in turn promotes inflammation, which has been linked to pimples in the past. The finding could eventually help create new drugs that can keep acne away. But it’s still very early, so the researchers warn against making any drastic changes to your diet or habits for now. \n \n \"It has been reported several times that people who take B12 develop acne.\" \n \n People sometimes take B12 as a supplement to improve memory or combat anemia. But \"it has been reported several times that people who take B12 develop acne,\" says Huiying Li, a molecular pharmacologist at the University of California-Los Angeles and a co-author of the study. \"So it’s exciting that we found that the potential link between B12 and acne is through the skin bacteria.\" \n \n More than 80 percent of teenagers and young adults have to deal with acne, often on a regular basis. It can go away on its own, but it can also lead to some pretty bad scarring — not to mention some big dips in self-esteem. Unfortunately, researchers don’t know nearly as much about this particular skin condition as one might expect. Scientists have shown that the production of sebum — the oily, waxy stuff your skin makes — and a disorder of the cells that line the inside of hair follicles are both involved in acne development, but the role of bacteria in those pimples we all dread still holds some mysteries. \n \n That's why Li and her team of researchers decided to look into B12. Since the 1950s, a number of studies have linked the vitamin to acne, but that association was largely anecdotal, Li says. And the researchers had suspected that the vitamin might have an effect on skin bacteria, most notably Propionibacterium acnes. Now, Li and her team think they may have figured out how B12 acts on P. acnes, thanks to experiments her team performed on bacteria taken from a small number of people. \n \n The study revealed that humans taking B12 end up with high levels of the vitamin in their skin. As a result, P. acnes senses these higher levels and lowers its own production of B12, which it uses to carry out its everyday bacteria-like activities. This causes an imbalance that prompts P. acnes to produce more porphyrins, a related molecule. And unfortunately porphyrins are linked to inflammation — a pretty important factor in the development of severe acne. \n \n \"The main message is that skin bacteria are important.\" \n \n Thus, it seems likely that for some people, taking B12 causes inflammation in the skin, which leads to acne. That last step in this pimply chain of events has yet to be demonstrated, however. Doing so will take a bit more time, Li says. \n \n \"The main message is that skin bacteria are important,\" Li says. They're contributing members of our skin's society, and they like to do things in a certain manner. But until other researchers confirm the link between B12 and acne in a larger number of people, dermatologists won’t really be able to make any clinical recommendations one way or the other, she says. Still, just knowing about the ways in which we can affect the organisms that live on our skin is pretty fun. \"I don't want people to misinterpret the results by not taking B12,\" Li says — this is all about the bacteria. ||||| It is an essential nutrient that helps the brain, nerves and blood work properly and which is found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy products and Marmite. \n \n But it turns out that vitamin B12 could be causing acne, the skin disorder that results in spots, pimples and blackheads, scientists have found. \n \n A new study has found that the vitamin changes the way bacteria behave on the skin of susceptible people. \n \n Vegan diets could be the key to getting rid of spots, because B12 is mostly found in animal products. But be warned: not getting enough of the vitamin can lead to fatigue and a lack of energy. \n \n The discovery could lead to new treatments for the distressing skin disorder, and shed light on why some people who take vitamin B12 supplements come out in spots. \n \n While it was already known that taking the vitamin pills can result in acne flare-ups, no-one knew exactly why. \n \n The new study solved the mystery by showing that the vitamin alters the metabolic activity of the skin bug responsible for acne, Propionibacterium acnes. \n \n This causes the bacteria to secrete an inflammatory compound that in turn triggers pimples. \n \n But the effect is not the same for everyone - some people are more vulnerable than others due to the complex interaction of bacteria and host. \n \n Researchers led by Dr Huiyang Li, from the University of California, Los Angeles, write in the journal Science Translational Medicine: \"Our findings suggest a new bacterial pathogenesis pathway in acne and provide one molecular explanation for the long-standing clinical observation that vitamin B12 supplementation leads to acne development in a subset of individuals. \n \n The paper adds that “interactions between the host and the skin … play essential roles in disease development”. \n \n The research involved testing 10 volunteers who were all given vitamin B12 supplements. Within a week, just one of them broke out in spots. \n \n To investigate what had happened the researchers collected bacterial samples from the participants' noses using deep-cleansing pore strips. \n \n They discovered that excess B12 quenched the bacteria's own production of the vitamin, which had the effect of boosting levels of an inflammatory compound, porphyrin, released by the bugs. Porphyrin is known to drive the inflammatory skin response linked to acne. \n \n Read more Vitamin B12 may protect brain, says report \n \n The researchers added: \"Future follow-up studies may potentially lead to the development of new therapeutics for this medically important disease.\" \n \n The study proves the link between B12 and skin bacteria - but that doesn't mean people should stop taking B12, the researchers stress. \n \n Vitamin B12 plays key roles in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and red blood cell formation. Deficiency of the vitamin can lead to fatigue and lack of energy. \n \n Perhaps the solution is to adopt a strict vegan diet – just make sure you avoid a certain divisive spread made out of yeast extract. \n \n Additional reporting by Press Association",
    "summary": "– Nature giveth, and nature taketh away. The same vitamin credited with helping the brain and nervous system—B12—is now accused of contributing to acne, reports the Independent. A new UCLA study suggests a link, though researchers emphasized that more research needs to be done to confirm what's actually happening. Still, the findings \"could raise questions about whether people with acne should take vitamin B12 supplements,\" observes Live Science. It seems that the vitamin changes the way skin bacteria behaves, which promotes inflammation, which in turn leads to pimples. Some people are more vulnerable than others. \"This study does present some compelling evidence suggesting that supplementation with B12 can cause or exacerbate acne in a subset of individuals,\" says a co-author of the study. She emphasizes that the research shows correlation, not causation. While previous studies have linked the vitamin to acne flareups, this is the first to provide details on how it interacts on a molecular level with bacteria, especially Propionibacterium acnes. One upside of the research is that it might eventually lead to better acne medication, reports the Verge. (Kids may be getting too many vitamins in cereal.)"

And there’s absolutely no hope for the future,” my mother-in-law told me recently. “Everyone is frightened, we just don’t know where to turn.” She was, of course, referring to the great Irish economic meltdown, now firmly entrenched in its third year. Her tremulous voice was thick with the famous Irish doom and gloom, but there was truth in her words. \n \n In the ’90s and early ’00s, double-digit economic growth made Ireland the European Union’s poster child for success. Dublin exploded from a sleepy backwater to a city boasting some of the most expensive real estate in Europe. And then it all ended. To quote a friend, “The party’s over and the hangover is feckin’ brutal.” My own home in the city lost half its value, seemingly overnight. But Ireland is more than just Dublin, and out in the picture-postcard west, where the rising tide never raised all boats, rural life was, and remains, dependent on the harvest and livestock. And so I decided to head out and see just how the recession was weighing on the Irish spirit far from the city lights. \n \n \n \n Slideshow: Andrew McCarthy describes Doolin’s otherworldly landscape and music scene (Photos by Seamus Murphy) \n \n I first arrived in Doolin, in County Clare, 25 years ago. A village of several hundred, strewn over a few miles on one main road, Doolin unfolds along a winding track that rises over a stone bridge, runs past two of the three pubs that anchor the town, dips into a swale, climbs over another bridge, works itself up a hill past a few shops and Gus O’Connor’s Pub, and then rolls down to the sea, where ferries ply the route to the Aran Islands. To the south, the coastline rises up into the Cliffs of Moher, 700 sheer feet of splendor above the Atlantic. Whitewashed houses with thatched roofs oversee sheep grazing across deep-green fields enclosed by crumbling stone walls that have stood for centuries. You can practically hear them singing “How are things in Glocca Morra?”—except that in Doolin, you’re more likely to catch the sounds of searing fiddles, rising flutes, and thumping bodhrán drums. The village has long been the epicenter of the traditional Irish music scene, and thanks largely to the success of Riverdance more than a decade ago, “trad” music is in the midst of a renaissance. On most every night, in any of Doolin’s three pubs, young musicians sit in, side by side with old, tearing into reels, jigs, and laments. The music may not have exempted Doolin from the recession, but it’s kept the place buzzing. “The people are still out and about, they’re just spending a lot less,” Orla McGovern tells me from behind the counter of her aptly named Traditional Music Shop on Fisher Street. \n \n Late in the evening, I squeeze onto a stool at a packed McDermott’s Pub and recognize Geraldine MacGowan—one of Doolin’s local heroes and an international trad star—sitting in with the boys. She’s hard to miss, with her head of thick red hair and her wicked smile. She keeps time on the bodhrán and nods greetings to patrons as she plays. Eventually, she takes the microphone and sings a mournful ballad of loss and regret and fear. The locals nod with understanding. \n \n At a break, Dolores Rice, a Dubliner down for the music and banter—the craic—explains, “Instilling fear is a Catholic tradition in Ireland. It’s something we’re very comfortable with. You can almost hear the priest say, ‘You thought you’d get away with your money grab, but the devil gets you in the end. You can’t sin without being punished.’” She looks around the crowded pub. “But we’re happy now, our most fatal certainty has been realized.” The Irish may have stopped going to church in large numbers, but it’s impossible to get the church out of the people. \n \n Outside, a light rain’s begun. I make my way over the stone bridge and past McGann’s Pub. The band inside is slashing into a reel, and I stand under the glow of the lone streetlamp, listening. The music burns to a crescendo and then breaks hard. There’s a moment of absolute silence in the countryside, and then it’s shattered as the crowd inside erupts. In Ireland, the day may have written checks the night can’t cash, but out here in Doolin, on this night at least, the credit’s still good. \n \n Andrew McCarthy is a contributing editor at National Geographic Traveler and an actor.

She was 35 years old but gave off the nervous pent-up sexual energy of a wallflower at prom, and with good reason: She had never kissed a man, let alone seen one nude in her Long Beach home. \n \n She had been carefree and pretty as a teenager—until a car accident sent her flying through a windshield, slicing her face open and blinding her in one eye, according to Larry. Afterwards, she thought, How could anyone ever love me? So she shut herself off to the world, to romantic love and sex. Until now. \n \n It was summer 1994 and Larry, who was a decade her senior, had instructions. \"I want you to stare at me,\" he ordered softly. \"Be scared. Be curious. Be excited. If you're bored, that's good. We'll move on.\" Soon they did, and—terrifying as it was—she stripped down, too. Then came kissing, caressing, and, eventually, sex. \n \n Read More: Learning How to Orgasm Without Any Touching \n \n \n \n Larry Villarin, a 62-year-old Californian, is not her boyfriend. Nor is he a sex worker, although technically he gets paid $150 per hour to have sex, hang out naked, and teach his clients the joys of the erotic. Larry is America's oldest male sexual surrogate, a job in which he risks being arrested in order to help others work through sexual dysfunction during one-on-one \"sessions.\" In the past 35 years, the gig has matched him with dozens of women (and an occasional man) to achieve therapeutic goals. In the past, he says, he has worked with disabled clients, abuse survivors, and people from strict religions backgrounds, as well as with millionaires, geniuses, 40-year-old virgins, and powerful judges. Most of clients pair his hands-on therapy with trips to a psychologist in order to prepare for real-life intimacy. \n \n She needed to believe I wouldn't laugh at her or run away. It was beautiful to see her open up. \n \n Only ten men are certified to do this work in the U.S., according to the International Professional Surrogates Association (IPSA). Larry and other rare men in the field must undergo 100 hours of human sexuality studies before becoming certified by the IPSA, which connects patients with surrogates through psychiatrists. As a sexual surrogate, Larry must navigate tricky emotional turf, like what happens when a client falls in love with you, or how to gently bust through body hang-ups or deeply internalized anxieties. In the case of the 35-year-old woman who had survived a car accident, it turned out that she was mostly scared of ridicule. \"She needed to believe I wouldn't laugh at her or run away. It was beautiful to see her open up,\" he says. \n \n Most of Larry's job is far less sexy than it might seem. During their first hour-long session with him, clients unload their emotional baggage —ranging from social anxiety to PTSD — and set therapy goals. No sexual touching is allowed. If all goes well, they'll move to hand stroking and a face caressing. Later, he'll try a blindfolded \"trust walk\" to get them \"out of their heads.\" \n \n His clients, who range in age from 22 to 75, usually invite Larry to their L.A. homes or come to his. Many are referred to him by a psychologist after reaching a frustrating impasse in expressing their sexuality: they can't become \"normal\" without a partner, and they can't find partner if they don't become \"normal.\" The steamy stuff comes slowly— if at all. \"You set ground rules,\" Larry says, \"It's baby steps.\" He works with some clients for weeks, others for years. Some are never ready to have full-blown sex. \n \n One of the tools Larry uses in order to help his clients open up is playing naked games. In one, he and the client stand back-to-back with their eyes closed. She opens her eyes first, then it's his turn. Eventually they go to a mirror and talk honestly about their reflections. It helps that Larry, a slow-talking old hippie type, is not at all physically threatening. \"I go first and stand in front of full-length mirror. I do an oral meditation, describing my body, tip to toe—how it feels and functions—totally honestly,\" he says. \"It really gets down to image. I say, 'I don't like my saggy buttocks,' or 'I broke my toe when I was 20.' I can do 30 minutes of that, just modeling openness. Then she goes.\" \n \n She had her first orgasm. She didn't believe she could ever have one. I'm getting misty about it. \n \n In addition, Larry says, physical exercises can lead to epiphanies. In one case, a 70-year-old woman had lived her whole life thinking sex was a chore; religious guilt kept her from masturbating. \"She was numb — her hips were frozen,\" Larry recalls. So he told her to stand with her legs apart. \"I said, 'Imagine a pencil coming down between your genitals and your anus. Now write your name on the floor. It required movements in her hips.\" \n \n Later that night, she took a shower and lay naked on her sheets. A breeze from an open window rolled over her body, and something shifted in her pelvis. \"That's all it took. She had her first orgasm. She didn't believe she could ever have one. I'm getting misty about it,\" Larry says. \"It's just: growth — what humans are capable of. Gosh, it's intimate stuff.\" \n \n Larry claims that birthdays are the number-one reason women come to see him. Late-in-life virgins, turning 30 or 40, see the date looming and want to take the plunge. \"Milestones are a big one. It's anxiety provoking. Women will say, 'This my final hope,'\" Larry says. \n \n Usually, those clients have control problems sparked by something early in life. If they don't address their issues with control, they tend to get worse, and their virginity becomes a symbol of everything wrong with them. \"They're embarrassed. Sometimes they can't talk to anyone about it,\" Larry notes. \"They try to fake it with girlfriends. But every new man has to be Mr. Right—perfect—so they run away at the first relationship glitch. The longer they wait, the more the anxiety builds.\" \n \n [Birthdays] are a big one. It's anxiety provoking. Women will say, 'This my final hope.' \n \n Emotional blocks can turn physical for some women. One client suffered from a condition called vaginismus, which caused her vaginal canal to tighten involuntarily, preventing sex. It was painful and embarrassing, so Larry recommended she use vaginal dilators for six months. Unlike a gynecologist, however, he paired that treatment with intimacy therapy and physical touch. It worked, he claims. \n \n Larry is a sort of a gateway guy, he says: He's low risk because he's not a real lover. \"The women are not there to please me; I'm there for them. Somewhere along the line, they stopped trusting men. I have to undo that.\" \n \n Although trust is deeply important to Larry's work, it's also important to keep an emotional distance. Larry says that some of his clients have fallen in love with him, which can push him into a tricky emotional and ethical gray area. \n \n One woman came to him, fresh out of an abusive marriage, on the heels of her son's death. She was sick of being alone and wanted to enjoy sex. \"We worked for two years. We had so many firsts together—she didn't want to let go,\" Larry recalls. When her sessions came to an end, Larry says, the client began sending him expensive gifts and kept trying to see him. \"I kind of knew she was in love with me. But I had to be ethical.\" \n \n Not long after that, he set up new boundaries: He stopped allowing sessions in his own bedroom and built a \"therapy room\" instead. After one of his own romantic relationships \"fell apart because of the job,\" he took a break from it. Now, he sometimes holds back sharing with clients because, \"by telling [a client] too much about myself, I realized, I am burdening her.\" \n \n The job is full of ethical landmines, according to Paula Hall, a British sex therapist. \"In the UK, the practice is mostly frowned upon,\" she says. The surrogate-client relationship is often seen as just too complicated, she adds. To Larry, however, the lines are clear enough. \"In a sense, we already know the relationship has to end. It's better that they learn how to be hurt with me, rather than a less sensitive man.\" \n \n Romantic feelings aren't the only issue complicating Larry's profession: Paying for sex — any sex —is illegal in the U.S., and there's no law offering surrogates special protection. If a cop were to bust in on Larry during a session, he could be arrested, which is exactly what happened to one of his female surrogate friends. \"She was seeing a client and he turned out to be a cop,\" Larry says. \"He said, 'I have to confess: In 10 minutes you're going to hear a knock on the door, and you're going to be busted for prostitution, but I can see that's not what this is.\" \n \n IPSA skirts prostitution law in certifying its members because it doesn't acknowledge intercourse is part of the practice, according to Larry and other current and former surrogates. Today, he's baffled that people don't understand the difference between his work, which he sees as primarily therapeutic or socially instructive. \n \n For instance, Larry once worked with a woman from a strict religious background. Because of her upbringing, she had learned to see kissing as strictly a sexual act, never used for casual affection. She enlisted Larry to teach her the basics of kissing in all different contexts. In their sessions, Larry says, she made the rules. \"We tried all of them: A quick kiss goodbye, a hello kiss, a marathon make out. I was never allowed to kiss back,\" he recounts. After a few weeks, she left feeling \"reborn,\" ready for lovers and friends. \"It did increase her confidence, oh my,\" Larry says. \n \n But most of the time, Larry never gets to see the positive affects of his work. \"The empowerment part comes when they leave me. It's like karate: Once you get your black belt, your training has just begun. With me, they've opened their hearts — and now they can go have a life.\"",

Second of all, the initial expansion of food-stamp eligibility happened under my Republican predecessor, not under me. No. 3, when you have a disastrous economic crash that results in 8 million people losing their jobs, more people are going to need more support from government.\" \n \n \"The larger point is this: that there's going to be a debate over the next eight, nine, 10 months about how to move the country forward,\" he said. \"They've got an argument.

    "document": "WASHINGTON, June 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- At Vice President Biden's National Cancer Moonshot Summit today, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and IBM Watson Health (NYSE: IBM) announced a public-private partnership to help doctors expand and scale access to precision medicine over the next two years for 10,000 American veterans with cancer. \n \n IBM's Watson for Genomics technology is expected to help in the department's precision oncology program by providing information to help physicians identify precision treatment options for almost 30 times more patients than could be previously served. \n \n VA oncologists Michael Kelley (left) and Neil Spector review a Watson for Genomics DNA analysis report. On Wednesday at VP Biden's National Cancer Moonshot Summit, VA and IBM launched a public-private partnership to help doctors expand and scale access to precision medicine over the next two years for 10,000 American veterans with cancer. (Photo Credit: Martha Hoelzer) \n \n The collaboration is expected to greatly speed up the ability of VA doctors to help identify precision treatment options for veterans. Scientists and pathologists will sequence DNA for cancer patients, then feed de-identified genetic alteration files into Watson. Watson will generate a report for physicians that identifies the likely cancer-causing mutations and possible treatment options to target those specific mutations through a comprehensive review of existing medical literature – a data-intensive process that has been time-consuming and difficult to scale in the past. \n \n \"Genetic alterations are responsible for most cancers, but it remains challenging for most clinicians to deliver on the promise of precision medicine due to the sheer volume of data surrounding each decision that needs to be made,\" said Department of Veterans Affairs Under Secretary for Health Dr. David J. Shulkin. \"By applying Watson to this problem, we see an opportunity to scale access to precision medicine for America's veterans, a group most deserving of the best care in the world.\" \n \n Veterans of war experience disproportionately high rates of cancer diagnosis and mortality and as America's largest integrated health system, VA serves 3.5 percent of the nation's cancer patients – the largest group of cancer patients in the country. Watson is expected to facilitate rapid access for veterans to personalized care, particularly for patients with advanced cancer. \n \n \"The power of cognitive computing is its ability to ingest, understand and find patterns in massive volumes of disparate data – which is one of the fundamental barriers to precision medicine today,\" said John Kelly, senior vice president, IBM Research and Cognitive Solutions. \"In addition to helping advance clinical care, data and insights from Watson will also be shared with the research community, creating tremendous potential benefits for patients, researchers and society. Watson Health is IBM's own moonshot, and we share the Vice President's vision and goals to advance the fight against cancer through data and collaboration.\" \n \n As a tool to help doctors evaluate treatment options for their patients, Watson for Genomics produces a list of potential therapies ranked by levels of evidence with links to associated research and clinical trials for physicians to consider. This information could help inform VA's healthcare professionals and veterans of promising new cancer treatments. The VA's top priorities of access to and quality of care could be enhanced through this innovative technology. \n \n IBM's commitment to VA follows more than 2 years of collaboration with more than 20 leading cancer institutes to train and validate Watson for Genomics. Early results from academic medical centers that are using Watson for Genomics show that the technology provides insights that match what a team of scientists and clinicians – a molecular tumor board – would uncover when analyzing genome sequencing data and suggesting potential treatment options to target cancer mutations. \n \n Both the VA and IBM have a history of innovation in the battle against cancer. The VA invested $52 million in 2015 to support nearly 250 cancer research projects, with a particular focus on better understanding and preventing cancers that are prevalent in the veteran population. IBM researchers have developed cognitive computing technologies that enable researchers and clinicians to draw insights from vast, disparate data sources, including structured and unstructured data. IBM is collaborating with healthcare organizations to apply the cognitive computing power of Watson to the data challenges of cancer. \n \n The collaboration between IBM and the VA is also expected to help advance genomic research. Findings related to the identified treatment options in the literature will be shared with the academic community. \n \n Learn more about this story on the IBM THINK Blog: http://asmarterplanet.com/blogs/think/2016/06/29/va-enlists-watson/ \n \n About the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n \n The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the second largest federal Department providing care to the nation's 22 million Veterans. VA promotes the health, welfare and dignity of Veterans in recognition of their service to the Nation through its Veterans Health Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration and the National Cemetery Administration. \n \n About IBM Watson Health \n \n Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015, the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit will work with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| IBM is teaming up with the federal government to bring Watson technology into America’s largest hospital and healthcare network. The initiative is one of the first public-private partnerships setup as part of Vice President Joe Biden’s Cancer Moonshot program. \n \n The partnership will bring IBM’s Watson for Genomics technology into the U.S. Department of Veterans Affair’s hospitals and doctors’ offices so that more former soldiers can access the best in precision medicine in the battle against cancer. That means veterans will now have top tier access to innovative genomic treatment options. Some 3.5% of the nation’s care patients are being treated at VA facilities, the largest group of cancer patients within a single health care group. \n \n Over the next two years, the VA hopes to treat 10,000 American veterans with targeted cancer therapies, an almost 30-fold increase from the number that is currently using those therapies today within the VA system. The initiative, which will be implemented and analyzing patient data by the third quarter this year, also gives the VA some much needed good news after investigations revealed ongoing manipulation of patient wait times and corruption among some employees. \n \n Watson for Genomics can provide accurate genomic analysis of a cancer’s DNA by cross-referencing the sequencing data with a comprehensive database of existing medical literature. It can create, within minutes, a report for physicians identifying likely cancer-causing mutations and provides a list of potential therapies ranked by levels of evidence, replacing a previously time-intensive process. \n \n “Genetic alterations are responsible for most cancers, but it remains challenging for most clinicians to deliver on the promise of precision medicine due to the sheer volume of data surrounding each decision that needs to be made,” said David J. Shulkin, Under Secretary for Health at the Department of Veterans Affairs in a statement. “By applying Watson to this problem, we see an opportunity to scale access to precision medicine for America’s veterans, a group most deserving of the best care in the world.” \n \n The public-private partnership is due to be officially announced Wednesday at the National Cancer Moonshot Summit, a gathering of scientists, oncologists, donors, and patients in Washington, D.C. The daylong conference is focused on more than a 100 different types of cancers and is meant to galvanize Biden’s cancer initiative, which aims to achieve a “decade worth of advances in 5 years.” The Cancer Moonshot is doing that with a multi-prong approach, offering funding, targeted incentives, and increased private-sector coordination. \n \n “It’s not just about developing game-changing treatments–it’s about delivering them those who need them,” Biden wrote in a post announcing the Cancer Moonshot in January. \n \n Right now, the way precision medicine works at top tier institutes is a board of 10 to 15 doctors, known as Molecular Tumor Boards, meet once a week to examine the DNA of cancer cells of about a dozen patients. They look for mutations in genetic sequences and then determine the best specific treatment to fight that abnormality. At that rate, that ends up equaling about 1,000 cases per year, notes Steve Harvey, vice president of IBM Watson Health. \n \n “You can see right there that this isn’t scalable,” Harvey told Fortune. “You’re limited by the number of patients that you can look at in any given week, which means that you limit the number of individuals that you can sequence.” \n \n If Watson for Genomics can help the VA expand its precision medicine program to 10,000 cases over two years, it should be quite meaningful for the Cancer Moonshot efforts. Watson for Genomics can sort patients by level of need, sending more straight-forward analyses directly to the treating oncologist; the more complex cases are reviewed and discussed by these expert boards. Another benefit with Watson for Genomics: patients don’t have to live near the top tier cancer institutes in areas like Boston or Houston or New York City to get the most innovative care. \n \n “Regardless of where you live, if your treating oncologist can have the same access to treatment alternatives and fact-based information as an oncologist in Boston or an oncologist in New York, that really is the democratization of health care.” ||||| Here's a question IBM supercomputer Watson never got to ask on \"Jeopardy\": What is a cure for cancer? \n \n Watson, best known for beating champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter on the game show, will get its chance as it aids scientists using analysis of gene structures to figure out the cause of and potential cures for different strains of cancer. IBM unveiled Watson for Genomics, specifically designed for this task, at the National Cancer Moonshot Summit on Wednesday. \n \n The addition of Watson's brain power, which can understand questions in natural language and not just the computer language of ones and zeros, could significantly accelerate cancer treatment. Typically, finding the appropriate treatment for a specific patient means sequencing his or her genome -- the complete DNA structure packed into a single cell -- finding mutations and then getting a team of seasoned doctors in a room to decide the best options. Watson can do it in less than three minutes. \n \n This is the latest in a series of deals IBM has made to use Watson to solve health care issues, as well as help out in far different areas, even the fashion industry. The software company provided Alder Hey Children's Hospital with the supercomputer to help improve patient care. Watson also worked with CVS Health to predict health problems a person might experience and give them advice. It even helped create a dress adorned with LED lights for the Met Gala that lit up in response to the mood on social media surrounding the event. \n \n The cognitive computing that Watson employs, making sense of unstructured data, falls into the broader field of artificial intelligence. AI has been experiencing a boom in recent months as more powerful processors and networks get more nimble at making sense of massive amounts of data. \n \n Watson for Genomics will take on the data-intensive task of searching through sequenced DNA of patients from the Veterans Affairs Department, finding mutations and scanning medical literature to pinpoint the therapeutic treatments that would work best. The program promises to identify customized regimens for 10,000 US veterans during the next two years. That's almost 30 times more patients that would receive appropriate treatment than if the team did not use Watson. \n \n \"It is time-intensive and it's not scalable,\" Dr. Michael Kelly, national program director for oncology at the VA, said on the current method of finding treatment. \"One human probably couldn't do it, it takes a panel.\" \n \n But a supercomputer can. \n \n Oncologists will feed Watson a sequence of DNA along with a list of the changes that are thought to cause the cancer, known as deidentified genetic alteration files. The computer will pump out a report of possible mutations as well as potential treatments after scanning contemporary medical literature and data. \n \n Rapidly parsing through a genome sequence might seem impressive, but, \"that's only one side of the coin,\" according to Stephen Harvey, vice president of Watson Health. \"The other half of the job is filtering out things that wouldn't be clinically valuable for doctors like Dr. Kelly.\" \n \n IBM chose the VA in part because the organization serves 3.5 percent of the country's cancer patients. \"I couldn't think of a better cohort,\" Harvey said. \n \n Correction, 4:54 a.m. PT: Michael Kelly's title has been fixed.",
    "summary": "– In January, President Obama handed the reins to Joe Biden to head a \"moonshot\" initiative to cure cancer, and a major step toward that end has just been made. Per Fortune, IBM will donate its Watson supercomputer technology—the same technology that beat humans on Jeopardy!, CNET notes—to Veterans Affairs hospitals and doctors' offices, offering precision genomic treatment to the largest cancer demographic (3.5% of all US cancer patients) in any one health-care group. At the National Cancer Moonshot Summit on Wednesday, the VA Department and IBM Watson Health said they hope to use this tech to scale up doctors' access to such treatment programs and help 10,000 or so veterans over the next two years, per a press release—about 30 times more than the current number in VA facilities using these treatments. \"By applying Watson … we see an opportunity to scale access to precision medicine for America's veterans, a group most deserving of the best care in the world,\" the VA's undersecretary for health says. How this \"Watson for Genomics\" will work: After DNA sequencing on cancer patients, that info will be plugged into Watson, which will analyze and cross-reference existing medical data and then spit out what's probably causing the cancer mutations and what precision treatment is likely the best option—a task that was previously extremely time-consuming due to the volume of data and not very scalable. Plus, physicians in any part of the country—not just those near urban centers with top cancer facilities—will have access. Forbes notes the project won't do much to help patients outside the VA system and that no one knows yet exactly how effective Watson will be at pulling off this ambitious job. But it says while \"efforts like the Cancer Moonshot have trouble living up to their own hype … they can grease the wheels of progress a little bit.\" (Watson released its own cookbook last year.)"

    "document": "SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n In a 2007 purchase of medicines from Merck KGaA, drugmaker Mylan picked up a decades-old product, the EpiPen auto injector for food allergy and bee-sting emergencies. Management first thought to divest the aging device, which logged only $200 million in revenue. Then Heather Bresch, now Mylan’s chief executive officer, hit on the idea of using old-fashioned marketing in part to boost sales among concerned parents of children with allergies. That started EpiPen, which delivers about $1 worth of the hormone epinephrine, on a run that’s resulted in its becoming a $1 billion-a-year product that clobbers its rivals and provides about 40 percent of Mylan’s operating profits, says researcher ABR|Healthco. EpiPen margins were 55 percent in 2014, up from 9 percent in 2008, ABR|Healthco estimates. \n \n Photo illustration: 731 \n \n How Mylan pulled that off is a textbook case in savvy branding combined with a massive public awareness campaign on the dangers of child allergies. Along the way, EpiPen’s wholesale price rose roughly 400 percent from about $57 each when Mylan acquired the product. “They have done a tremendous job of taking an asset that nobody thought you could do much with and making it a blockbuster product,” says Jason Gerberry, a Leerink Partners analyst. \n \n But while EpiPen has given countless parents a sense of security that their children can go out in the world safely, the device’s soaring price—up 32 percent in the past year alone—has forced some families to make difficult choices in order to afford the life-saving medicine. The price increases are among the biggest of any top-selling brand drug, according to DRX, a unit of Connecture that tracks drug pricing. After insurance company discounts, a package of two EpiPens costs about $415, DRX says. By comparison, in France, where Meda sells the drug, two EpiPens cost about $85. “There is a danger with that,” says George Sillup, chairman of the pharmaceutical and health-care marketing department at Saint Joseph’s University. If the company raises the price too much, “that could create some backlash.” \n \n The company sees it differently. “Mylan has worked tirelessly over the past years advocating for increased anaphylaxis awareness, preparedness, and access to treatment,” Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in a statement. She said the company doesn’t control final retail prices for EpiPen and offers coupons that eliminate co-pays for most patients. Bresch declined to comment for this story. \n \n The CEO has made no secret of her strategy to increase demand for EpiPens by getting them stocked for emergency use in more schools and other public places. (So-called entity prescriptions allow for this.) “We are continuing to open up new markets, new access with public entity legislation that would allow restaurants and hotels and really anywhere you are congregating, there should be access to an EpiPen,” Bresch said at a conference on Sept. 17. \n \n Over the past seven years, Mylan has hired consultants who had worked with Medtronic to get defibrillators stocked in public places. Bresch, the daughter of Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), turned to Washington for help. Along with patient groups, Mylan pushed for federal legislation encouraging states to stock epinephrine devices in schools. \n \n CEO Bresch Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg \n \n In 2010 new federal guidelines said patients who had severe allergic reactions should be prescribed two epinephrine doses, and soon after Mylan stopped selling single pens in favor of twin-packs. At the time, 35 percent of prescriptions were for single EpiPens. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had changed label rules to allow the devices to be marketed to anyone at risk, rather than only those who’d already had an anaphylaxis reaction. “Those were both big events that we’ve started to capitalize on,” Bresch said in October 2011. \n \n In 2013, the year following the widely publicized death of a 7-year-old girl at a school in Virginia after an allergic reaction to peanuts, Congress passed legislation encouraging states to have epinephrine devices on hand in schools. Now 47 states require or encourage schools to stock the devices. \n \n Since 2012, Mylan has helped popularize its brand by handing out free EpiPens to more than 59,000 schools. Last year it signed a deal with Walt Disney to stock EpiPens in Disney’s theme parks and on cruise ships. And Mylan spent $35.2 million on EpiPen TV ads in 2014, up from $4.8 million in 2011, according to researcher Nielsen. Mylan disputes the ad spending figures but declines to offer alternatives. \n \n In part because of Mylan’s efforts, the number of patients using EpiPen has grown 67 percent over the past seven years. Many kids with allergies own multiple sets, for school and home. And for doctors, who write prescriptions for the name they know best, the EpiPen brand “is like Kleenex,” says Robert Wood, a pediatric allergist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \n \n So far rivals haven’t been able to break Mylan’s market grip. Sanofi’s Auvi-Q, introduced in 2013, is in the shape of a credit card and—unlike EpiPen—gives step-by step audio instructions. But Sanofi priced Auvi-Q about the same as EpiPen, and the product struggled initially to gain insurance coverage. Sanofi says 9 out of 10 patients with commercial insurance can now receive coverage for Auvi-Q prescriptions. Yet in the first half of 2015, EpiPen had about an 85 percent share of epinephrine prescriptions vs. only 10 percent for Auvi-Q, according to Symphony Health Solutions data compiled by Bloomberg. \n \n Still, allergy sufferers without generous health benefits feel the pain. Denise Ure, a social worker in Seattle, has a peanut allergy so severe that the last time she ingested a nut crumb in 2011, she needed three EpiPens and was hospitalized. Ure says she cried last year when she found out a prescription for two EpiPens would cost her about $350. “I was terrified because there’s this life-saving medicine that I needed, and I couldn’t afford it,” she says. Ure now carries two EpiPens she got in Canada, where they cost about half as much. \n \n The biggest threat to EpiPen could come from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. It settled a patent lawsuit in 2012 allowing it to market a generic version of EpiPen as early as this year, if it wins FDA approval. Mylan isn’t too worried. Predicted Bresch in August: “You would not see the traditional market loss because of just the brand equity with EpiPen.” \n \n The bottom line: When Mylan bought EpiPen in 2007, the devices had $200 million in annual sales. Today revenue exceeds $1 billion. \n \n (This story updated the graphic to show a more accurate usage of the EpiPen.) \n \n (This story updated the graphic to show a more accurate usage of the EpiPen.) ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Ben Popken \n \n The cost of saving your child's life has gotten a lot more expensive. \n \n Parents getting ready for back-to-school season have another item to toss in the basket along with Trapper Keepers and boxes of pencils — and they're facing sticker shock at the latest price increase. \n \n Doctors and patients say the Mylan pharmaceutical company has jacked up the prices for an EpiPen — the portable device that can stop a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction — from around $100 in 2008 to $500 and up today. \n \n That's a hike of over 400 percent. \n \n Mylan didn't invent the EpiPen, it acquired it in 2007, getting a drug that had been approved since 1987 and had 90 percent market dominance. Nor does it manufacture the EpiPen itself. Mylan buys it from a wholly owned Pfizer subsidiary for $34.50 per pen. \n \n Then in 2009, Mylan launched an upgraded device. A medical device technology expert and a doctor who took apart the \"before\" and \"after\" versions of the EpiPen found that despite safety and graphics upgrades, the auto-injectors shared a similar \"core.\" \n \n Now former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli has weighed in, calling the Mylan company \"vultures.\" \n \n U.S. Senators are scrutinizing the price hikes, with one calling for an FTC probe. Connecticut Senator Richard Bluemnthal, who pushed for emergency epinephrine to be stocked in public schools, pledged Friday to investigate the \"shocking increase.\" \n \n UPDATE: On 9/21/16, the House Oversight Committee grilled Mylan and the FDA in a hearing on the EpiPen price hike. \n \n \"Patients are calling and saying they can't afford it,\" said Dr. Douglas McMahon, an allergy specialist in Maplewood, Minnesota. \"They're between a rock and a hard place.\" \n \n Following a recall by Mylan's chief competitor last year, the company now enjoys a near monopoly. \n \n Because of aggressive marketing and branding campaigns, and lobbying for legislation that requires the product to be stocked in schools, they have a brand dominance equal to that of Kleenex, doctors say. \n \n About the size of a fat marker, they are carried by many parents of kids with severe allergies wherever they go — ready to jam the gizmo into their child's thigh to deliver epinephrine and stop anaphylactic shock from a potentially fatal bee sting or bit of peanut. \n \n An EpiPen. Carlos Osorio / AP file \n \n And because they have a stated expiration date of one year, parents refill them annually, incurring an additional co-pay each time. \n \n Tracy Bush, a 42-year-old mom and food allergy consultant, never goes anywhere without two EpiPens on her. Her son, age 14, carries another. She began doing so after he was diagnosed with severe allergies as a 2-year-old. \n \n For the past 10 years, she has watched the price she paid for her refills rise higher and higher with no discernible improvement to the device or medicine. \n \n In 2008, Bush said the price was $145.99. In 2010, it was $220.99, then jumped to $649.99. This year her pre-insurance costs were $1,118.08. \n \n Despite the hikes, Bush was glad to have the device two years ago when her son had a bad reaction while eating some watermelon. \n \n \"He said it felt like a potato chip was caught in his throat. Then he got a look of terror on his face. His voice was totally different, it sounded like he had sucked helium. I was like 'Oh my goodness, I'm going to have to use an EpiPen,'\" she said. \"I will never forget the look that I saw.\" \n \n In a statement, Mylan said that the prices have \"changed over time to better reflect important product features and the value the product provides,\" and that \"we've made a significant investment to support the device over the past years.\" \n \n The company also offers coupons on its website that can reduce costs. This year, for the first time, Bush was able to use those coupons and her \"good\" insurance plan to bring down her out-of-pocket costs to zero. But not everyone can do the same. \n \n \"When epinephrine only costs a few cents, but they're going up to $500, personally I don't think that's ethically responsible,\" said Dr. McMahon. \n \n And he understands better than most what costs are involved: For the past few years he's been developing his own, smaller version of the EpiPen, and trying to get it approved by the FDA and bring it to market. He estimates that process costs about $1.5 million. In 2015, Mylan's profits from the sale of EpiPens rose to $1.2 billion. \n \n McMahon says his device will retail for about $50. \n \n Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the former presidential contender and a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, told NBC News in a statement: \n \n \"The drug industry's greed knows no bounds. There's no reason an EpiPen, which costs Mylan just a few dollars to make, should cost families more than $600. The only explanation for Mylan raising the price by six times since 2009 is that the company values profits more than the lives of millions of Americans.\" ||||| Families with severe allergies often rely on EpiPens to deliver a dose of potentially life-saving medicine if a child has a bad reaction. But the cost of the EpiPen is surging, putting the pinch on many families. \n \n The EpiPen is filled with epinephrine, which can counter the effects of a severe allergic reaction. The auto-injector's price has risen by more than 480 percent since 2009. The actual cost of the drug inside the EpiPen is only a couple bucks, reports CBS News correspondent Vinita Nair. So the manufacturer is essentially charging hundreds of dollars for a case -- and a trusted name. \n \n An EpiPen is never far away in the Henegar household where dinner time is a cautious time. Of the family's six children, two have severe food allergies: 3-year-old Cora and 7-year-old Ellie. \n \n Ellie has a laundry list of foods to avoid, including dairy, wheat, soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts and sesame seeds. It's why both girls never leave their Indianapolis-area home without their fanny packs. \n \n As a baby, Ellie's allergic reactions were so severe, hives covered her entire body. Her family has twice used the EpiPen to save her life. \n \n \"Her lips turned blue, she started swelling, she wasn't able to breathe,\" mother Lexi Henegar recalled. \n \n They have to replace the injectors every year when they expire. The Henegars remember paying as little as $80 for them five or six years ago before they switched to a high-deductible health plan. \n \n \"We really noticed it in the past year, year and a half when we went to go have it filled. It was $600,\" Lexi said. \n \n \"When the pharmacist first told you the bill, did you think 'You must be wrong?'\" Nair asked. \n \n \"I did. I had her look it up again and she didn't have to because she had answered that question many times with many other people who asked her the same question of, 'Are you sure that the EpiPen is that expensive -- and it is,\" Lexi said. \n \n In 2009, pharmacies paid slightly more than $100 for a 2-pack of EpiPens. The price has since skyrocketed to more than $600. \n \n \"If they don't have [the EpiPen], it could mean life or death,\" pharmacist Leon Tarasenko said. \n \n Tarasenko said the high prices are forcing some families to take risks. \n \n \"Within the last two months, we've had about three patients who had issues with the price of an EpiPen. And we actually -- they did not receive it. They just refused to take it,\" Tarasenko said. \n \n Bloomberg senior medical reporter Robert Langreth says the manufacturer of the device, Mylan, has a virtual monopoly after its main competitor launched a recall last fall. \n \n \"This brand name, EpiPen, it's like Kleenex to allergists,\" Langreth said. \"You know, it's a name they know and trust. It's what they prescribe.\" \n \n He said the company has remarketed the decades-old device without making any significant changes since acquiring it in 2007. It has spent tens of millions of dollars on TV ads and donated the device to schools across the U.S., ensuring it was a familiar product. \n \n \"It's a totally established brand name with little competition,\" Langreth said. \"That gives them freedom to raise the price every year.\" \n \n In a statement, Mylan tells CBS News the EpiPen's price \"has changed over time to better reflect important product features and the value the product provides,\" saying \"we've made a significant investment to support the device over the past years.\" \n \n The company offers coupons, which have allowed many patients to pay nothing out-of-pocket. Those coupons are worth up to $100, so families with high deductibles like the Henegars are still on the hook for the majority of the cost.",
    "summary": "– It's the size of a marker and as common as Band-Aids in a school nurse's office. EpiPen, a device that delivers a dose of epinephrine that can stop an extreme allergic reaction, has been credited with saving the lives of children for whom a peanut or a bee sting could be fatal. But drugmaker Mylan has hiked the price of the device by nearly 500% over the past few years, CBS News reports, and parents and doctors aren't happy. \"When epinephrine only costs a few cents, but they're going up to $500, personally I don't think that's ethically responsible,\" allergy specialist Dr. Douglas McMahon told NBC News. “Patients are calling and saying they can't afford it.” (McMahon is seeking FDA approval for his own device that he says will cost $50.) Twice in her seven years, Ellie Henegar’s life was saved with an EpiPen, but her parents were stunned last year when the bill came to $600, they told CBS. Compare that to 2009, when the bill was about $100 for the same two-pack of EpiPen. While insurance covers varying degrees of the cost, not everyone is lucky enough to have a plan that does, NBC notes. With a near monopoly, Mylan has little incentive to cut the price, Bloomberg reports. In fact, Mylan execs considered dumping the aging product in 2007. Instead, they launched a marketing campaign that turned the device into an essential, donating EpiPens to schools and dropping $35 million on TV ads. A law passed by Congress in 2013 requiring schools to stock epinephrine devices also boosted sales, which last year totaled $1 billion. Mylan contends it has made a \"significant investment\" to improve the device and offers coupons. \"It's a totally established brand name with little competition,\" Bloomberg’s Robert Langreth tells CBS. \"That gives them freedom to raise the price every year.\""

    "document": "In any given year, more than 1 in 4 Americans who are old enough to drive have some kind of encounter with a police officer, usually as a result of a traffic stop. If these interactions go smoothly, the police build respect within their community. If they don't, the public's trust in law enforcement erodes, and citizens may become less willing \"to support or cooperate with the police,\" the study authors said. ||||| Police officers speak significantly less respectfully to black than to white community members in everyday traffic stops, even after controlling for officer race, infraction severity, stop location, and stop outcome. This paper presents a systematic analysis of officer body-worn camera footage, using computational linguistic techniques to automatically measure the respect level that officers display to community members. This work demonstrates that body camera footage can be used as a rich source of data rather than merely archival evidence, and paves the way for developing powerful language-based tools for studying and potentially improving police–community relations. \n \n Using footage from body-worn cameras, we analyze the respectfulness of police officer language toward white and black community members during routine traffic stops. We develop computational linguistic methods that extract levels of respect automatically from transcripts, informed by a thin-slicing study of participant ratings of officer utterances. We find that officers speak with consistently less respect toward black versus white community members, even after controlling for the race of the officer, the severity of the infraction, the location of the stop, and the outcome of the stop. Such disparities in common, everyday interactions between police and the communities they serve have important implications for procedural justice and the building of police–community trust. \n \n Over the last several years, our nation has been rocked by an onslaught of incidents captured on video involving police officers’ use of force with black suspects. The images from these cases are disturbing, both exposing and igniting police–community conflict all over the country: in New York, Missouri, Ohio, South Carolina, Maryland, Illinois, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and North Carolina. These images have renewed conversations about modern-day race relations and have led many to question how far we have come (1). In an effort to increase accountability and transparency, law enforcement agencies are adopting body-worn cameras at an extremely rapid pace (2, 3). \n \n Despite the rapid proliferation of body-worn cameras, no law enforcement agency has systematically analyzed the massive amounts of footage these cameras produce. Instead, the public and agencies alike tend to focus on the fraction of videos involving high-profile incidents, using footage as evidence of innocence or guilt in individual encounters. \n \n Left unexamined are the common, everyday interactions between the police and the communities they serve. By best estimates, more than one quarter of the public (ages 16 y and over) comes into contact with the police during the course of a year, most frequently as the result of a police-initiated traffic stop (4, 5). Here, we examine body-worn camera footage of routine traffic stops in the large, racially diverse city of Oakland, CA. \n \n Routine traffic stops are not only common, they are consequential, each an opportunity to build or erode public trust in the police. Being treated with respect builds trust in the fairness of an officer’s behavior, whereas rude or disrespectful treatment can erode trust (6, 7). Moreover, a person’s experiences of respect or disrespect in personal interactions with police officers play a central role in their judgments of how procedurally fair the police are as an institution, as well as their willingness to support or cooperate with the police (8, 9). \n \n Blacks report more negative experiences in their interactions with the police than other groups (10). Across numerous studies, for example, blacks report being treated less fairly and respectfully in their contacts with the police than whites (6, 11). Indeed, some have argued that racial disparities in perceived treatment during routine encounters help fuel the mistrust of police in the controversial officer-involved shootings that have received such great attention. However, do officers treat white community members with a greater degree of respect than they afford to blacks? \n \n We address this question by analyzing officers’ language during vehicle stops of white and black community members. Although many factors may shape these interactions, an officer’s words are undoubtedly critical: Through them, the officer can communicate respect and understanding of a citizen’s perspective, or contempt and disregard for their voice. Furthermore, the language of those in positions of institutional power (police officers, judges, work superiors) has greater influence over the course of the interaction than the language used by those with less power (12⇓⇓⇓–16). Measuring officer language thus provides a quantitative lens on one key aspect of the quality or tone of police–community interactions, and offers new opportunities for advancing police training. \n \n Previous research on police–community interactions has relied on citizens’ recollection of past interactions (10) or researcher observation of officer behavior (17⇓⇓–20) to assess procedural fairness. Although these methods are invaluable, they offer an indirect view of officer behavior and are limited to a small number of interactions. Furthermore, the very presence of researchers may influence the police behavior those researchers seek to measure (21). \n \n In study 1, human participants rated officer utterances on several overlapping dimensions of respect. With a high degree of agreement, participants inferred these dimensions from officer language. Even though they were not told the race of the stopped driver, participants judged officer language directed toward black motorists to be less respectful than language directed toward whites. In study 2, we build statistical models capable of predicting aspects of respect based on linguistic features derived from theories of politeness, power, and social distance. We discuss the linguistic features that contribute to each model, finding that particular forms of politeness are implicated in perceptions of respect. In study 3, we apply these models to all vehicle stop interactions between officers of the Oakland Police Department and black/white community members during the month of April 2014. We find strong evidence that utterances spoken to white community members are consistently more respectful, even after controlling for contextual factors such as the severity of the offense or the outcome of the stop. \n \n Data \n \n Our dataset consists of transcribed body camera footage from vehicle stops of white and black community members conducted by the Oakland Police Department during the month of April 2014. We examined 981 stops of black (N = 682) and white (N = 299) drivers from this period, 68.1% of the 1,440 stops of white and black drivers in this period. These 981 stops were conducted by 245 different officers (see SI Appendix, Data Sampling Process for inclusion criteria). Per Oakland Police Department policy, officers turn on their cameras before making contact with the driver and record for the duration of the stop. From the 183 h of footage in these interactions, we obtain 36,738 usable officer utterances for our analysis. \n \n Study 1: Perceptions of Officer Treatment from Language. We first test whether human raters can reliably judge respect from officers’ language, and whether these judgments reveal differences in officer respect toward black versus white community members. Respect is a complex and gradient perception, incorporating elements of a number of correlated constructs like friendliness and formality. Therefore, in this study, we ask participants to rate transcribed utterances spoken by officers along five conceptually overlapping folk notions related to respect and officer treatment. We randomly sampled 414 unique officer utterances (1.1% of all usable utterances in the dataset) directed toward black (N = 312) or white (N = 102) community members. On each trial, participants viewed the text of an officer utterance, along with the driver’s utterance that immediately preceded it. All proper names and places were anonymized, and participants were not told the race or gender of the driver. Participants indicated on four-point Likert scales how respectful, polite, friendly, formal, and impartial the officer was in each exchange. Each utterance was rated by at least 10 participants. Could participants reliably glean these qualities from such brief exchanges? Previous work has demonstrated that different perceivers can arrive at similar judgments from “thin slices” of behavior (22). In a similar vein, participants showed consistency in their perceptions of officer language, with reliability for each item ranging from moderate (Cronbach’s α = 0.73) to high ( α = 0.91) agreement (see SI Appendix, Annotator Agreement). These results demonstrate that transcribed language provides a sufficient and consensual signal of officer communication, enough to gain a picture of the dynamics of an interaction at a given point in time. To test whether participant ratings uncovered racial group differences, we averaged scores across raters to calculate a single rating on each dimension for each utterance, then built a linear mixed-effects regression model to estimate the fixed effect of community member race across interactions, controlling for variance of a random effect at the interaction level. Officer utterances directed toward black drivers were perceived as less respectful [b = −0.23, 95% confidence interval (−0.34, −0.11)], polite [b = −0.23 (−0.35, −0.12)], friendly [b = −0.24 (−0.36, −0.12)], formal [b = −0.16 (−0.30, −0.03)], and impartial [b = −0.26 (−0.39, −0.12)] than language directed toward white drivers (Fig. 1). These differences persisted even when controlling for the age and sex of the driver (see SI Appendix, Model Outputs for Each Rated Dimension). Fig. 1. (Left) Differences in raw participant ratings between interactions with black and white community members. (Right) When collapsed to two uncorrelated components, Respect and Formality, we find a significant difference for Respect but none for Formality. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. PC, principal component. Given the expected conceptual overlap in the five perceptual categories we presented to the participants, we used principal component analysis to decompose the ratings into their underlying components. Two principal components explained 93.2% of the variance in the data (see SI Appendix, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Loadings for loadings). The first component, explaining 71.3% of the variance and composed of positive loadings on the impartial, respectful, friendly, and polite dimensions with some loading on the formal dimension, we characterize as Respect, broadly construed. The second, explaining 21.9% of the variance and composed primarily of a very high positive loading on the formal dimension and a weak negative loading on the friendly dimension, we characterize as Formality. This component captures formality as distinct from respect more generally, and is likely related to social distance. Standardizing these factor scores as outcome variables in mixed-effects models, we find that officers were equal in Formality with white and black drivers [ β = −0.01 (−0.19, 0.16)], but higher in Respect with white drivers [ β = 0.17 (0.00, 0.33)] (Fig. 1). Study 1 demonstrates that key features of police treatment can be reliably gleaned from officer speech. Participant ratings from thin slices of police–community interactions reveal racial disparities in how respectful, impartial, polite, friendly, and formal officers’ language to community members was perceived. Such differences were driven by differences in the Respect officers communicated toward drivers rather than the Formality with which officers addressed them. \n \n Study 2: Linguistic Correlates of Respect. The methods of study 1 (human coding of 414 individual utterances), although effective at discovering racial disparities in officer respect toward community members in our dataset, cannot offer a general solution to the analysis of body camera data. One problem is scale: Each year, on the order of 26 million vehicle stops are made (5). Furthermore, using only a small sample of individual utterances makes it impossible to study how police treatment varies over officers, or how the interaction progresses across time in each stop. In this study, we therefore develop computational linguistic models of respect and formality and tune them on the 414 individual utterances; in study 3, we apply these models to our full dataset of 36,738 utterances. Our method is based on linguistic theories of respect that model how speakers use respectful language (apologizing, giving agency, softening of commands, etc.) to mitigate “face-threatening acts.” We use computational linguistic methods (e.g., refs. 23⇓⇓–26) to extract features of the language of each officer utterance. The log-transformed counts of these features are then used as independent variables in two linear regression models predicting the perceptual ratings of Respect and Formality from study 1. Our model-assigned ratings agree with the average human from study 1 about as well as humans agree with each other. Our model for Respect obtains an adjusted R2 of 0.258 on the perceptual ratings obtained in study 1, and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.840, compared with an RMSE of 0.842 for the average rater relative to other raters. Our model for Formality obtains an adjusted R2 of 0.190, and an RMSE of 0.882 compared with 0.764 for the average rater (see SI Appendix, Model Comparison to Annotators for more details on how these values were calculated). These results indicate that, despite the sophisticated social and psychological cues participants are likely drawing upon in rating officers’ utterances, a constrained set of objectively measurable linguistic features can explain a meaningful portion of the variance in these ratings. Fig. 2 lists the linguistic features that received significant weights in our model of Respect (arranged by their model coefficients). For example, apologizing, gratitude, and expressions of concern for citizen safety are all associated with respect. The bars on the right show the log-odds of the relative proportion of interactions in our dataset taken up by each feature, where negative numbers mean that a feature comprised a larger proportion of officers’ speech in interactions with black community members and positive numbers mean the same for interactions with white community members. Example utterances containing instances of the highest-weighted features for the Respect model are shown in Fig. 3. See SI Appendix, Study 2 for full regression outputs and more detailed discussion of particular linguistic findings. Fig. 2. (Left) Respect weights assigned by final model to linguistic features and (Right) the corresponding log-odds of those features occurring in officer speech directed toward black versus white community members, calculated using Fisher’s exact test. †P < 0.1; ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; ∗∗∗P < 0.001. Fig. 3. Sample sentences with automatically generated Respect scores. Features in blue have positive coefficients in the model and connote respect, such as offering reassurance (“no problem”) or mentioning community member well-being (“drive safe”). Features in red have negative coefficients in the model and connote disrespect, like informal titles (“my man”), or disfluencies (“that- that’s”). \n \n Study 3: Racial Disparities in Respect. Having demonstrated that people can reliably infer features of procedural justice from officer speech (study 1), and that these ratings can be reliably predicted from statistical models of linguistic features (study 2), we are now able to address our central question: Controlling for contextual factors of the interaction, is officers’ language more respectful when speaking to white as opposed to black community members? We apply our models from study 2 to the entire corpus of transcribed interactions to generate predicted scores for Respect and Formality for each of the 36,738 utterances in our dataset. We then build linear mixed-effects models for Respect and Formality over these utterances. We include, as covariates in our primary model, community member race, age, and gender; officer race; whether a search was conducted; and the result of the stop (warning, citation, or arrest). We include random intercepts for interactions nested within officers. Controlling for these contextual factors, utterances spoken by officers to white community members score higher in Respect [ β = 0.05 (0.03, 0.08)]. Officer utterances were also higher in Respect when spoken to older [ β = 0.07 (0.05, 0.09)] community members and when a citation was issued [ β = 0.04 (0.02, 0.06)]; Respect was lower in stops where a search was conducted [ β = −0.08 (−0.11, −0.05)]. Officer race did not contribute a significant effect. Furthermore, in an additional model on 965 stops for which geographic information was available, neither the crime rate nor density of businesses in the area of the stop were significant, although a higher crime rate was indicative of increased Formality [ β = 0.03 (0.01, 0.05)]. One might consider the hypothesis that officers were less respectful when pulling over community members for more severe offenses. We tested this by running another model on a subset of 869 interactions for which we obtained ratings of offense severity on a four-point Likert scale from Oakland Police Department officers, including these ratings as a covariate in addition to those mentioned above. We found that the offense severity was not predictive of officer respect levels, and did not substantially change the results described above. To consider whether this disparity persists in the most “everyday” interactions, we also reran our analyses on the subset of interactions that did not involve arrests or searches (N = 781), and found the results from our earlier models were fundamentally unchanged. Full regression tables for all models described above are given in SI Appendix, Study 3. Another hypothesis is that the racial disparities might have been caused by officers being more formal to white community members, and more informal or colloquial to black community members. However, we found that race was not associated with the formality of officers’ utterances. Instead, utterances were higher in Formality in interactions with older [ β = 0.05 (0.03, 0.07)] and female [ β = 0.02 (0.00, 0.04)] community members. Are the racial disparities in the respectfulness of officer speech we observe driven by a small number of officers? We calculated the officer-level difference between white and black stops for every officer (N = 90) in the dataset who had interactions with both blacks and whites (Fig. 4). We find a roughly normal distribution of these deltas for officers of all races. This contrasts with the case of stop-and-frisk, where individual outlier officers account for a substantial proportion of racial disparities (27); the disparities we observe here cannot be explained by a small number of extreme officers. Fig. 4. Kernel density estimate of individual officer-level differences in Respect when talking to white as opposed to black community members, for the 90 officers in our dataset who have interactions with both blacks and whites. More positive numbers on the x axis represent a greater positive shift in Respect toward white community members. Because our model is able to generate scores across all utterances in our dataset, we can also consider aspects of the trajectory of interactions beyond the mean level of respect (Fig. 5). Growth-curve analyses revealed that officers spoke with greater Respect [ b = 0.35 (0.29, 0.40)] and reduced Formality [ b = −0.57 (−0.62, −0.53)] as interactions progressed. However, these trajectories varied by community member race: Although stops of white and black drivers converged in the Formality expressed during the interaction [ b = −0.09 (−0.13, −0.05)], the gap in Respect increased over time [ b = 0.10 (0.05, 0.15)]. That is, officer Respect increased more quickly in interactions with white drivers [ b = 0.45 (0.38, 0.54)] than in interactions with black drivers [ b = 0.24 (0.19, 0.29)]. Fig. 5. Loess-smoothed estimates of the (Left) Respect and (Right) Formality of officers’ utterances relative to the point in an interaction at which they occur. Respect tends to start low and increase over an interaction, whereas the opposite is true for Formality. The race discrepancy in Respect is consistent throughout the interactions in our dataset. ||||| The first major US study of body-cam footage concluded that police, at least in Oakland, California, showed more respect to white people than to black people. \n \n The study from Stanford University researchers analyzed the transcribed text from 981 traffic stops caught on body cams by 245 Oakland Police Department officers in 2014. White people pulled over were more likely to be called \"ma'am\" or \"sir,\" and they were more likely to hear the words \"please\" and \"thank you\" from police officers. Black people, however, didn't get as much respect, and they were more likely to be called by their first names and even \"my man.\" \n \n \"Indeed, we find that white community members are 57 percent more likely to hear an officer say one of the most respectful utterances in our dataset, whereas black community members are 61 percent more likely to hear an officer say one of the least respectful utterances in our dataset,\" according to the study. (PDF) The results held constant no matter the race of the officer, the study said. \n \n The researchers point out that their survey underscores that data collected from body cams can have more uses than for just police work. They say their research model can be duplicated with other police departments. \n \n \"This work demonstrates the power of body-camera footage as an important source of data, not just as evidence,\" the researchers found. \n \n The researchers cautioned that the study was conducted with only the transcripts of 183 hours of body-cam footage, not the footage itself. And privacy concerns notwithstanding, the researchers said that more could be learned from body-cam studies if they listened to the audio and watched the footage. They wrote: \n \n However, studying body-camera footage presents numerous hurdles, including privacy concerns and the raw scale of the data. The computational linguistic models presented here offer a path toward addressing both these concerns, allowing for the analysis of transcribed datasets of any size, and generating reliable ratings of respect automatically. \n \n A review of the actual footage could also act as a teaching moment for police departments. \"In addition, footage analysis could help us better understand what linguistic acts lead interactions to go well, which can inform police training and quantify its impacts over time,\" they said. \n \n The studies presented here open a path toward these future opportunities and represent an important area of research for the study of policing: computational, large-scale analyses of language give us a way to examine and improve police–community interaction that we have never had before. \n \n They said they are releasing all of the code of their \"computational linguistic models\" for others to use. \n \n The research was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board with the cooperation of the Oakland Police Department. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The researchers used body cam footage in their research \n \n California police officers speak less respectfully to members of the public who are black than to those who are white, researchers studying body camera footage say. \n \n Scientists developed a way to measure levels of respect, based on the officers' language during routine traffic stops in Oakland City. \n \n The study is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n It aims to use bodycam footage to help improve police-community relations. \n \n While bodycam footage has been used as evidence in criminal cases - including some where complaints have been made against police - the aim of this study was to turn this continuously gathered footage into data and use that to track and improve everyday policing. \n \n \"These routine interactions are important,\" said lead scientist Prof Jennifer Eberhardt, \"they're the way most people encounter the police.\" \n \n \"And people care as much about how they're treated as whether or not they got a [speeding] ticket. \n \n \"It can affect how people view the police, how they think about the police - whether or not they want to co-operate with them.\" \n \n Evidence or data?

    "document": "Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Chicago. | AP Photo/John Locher Defying Trump, Chicago will continue as immigrant sanctuary \n \n CHICAGO — Joining other cities around the country, Chicago is pledging to remain a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants, an act of defiance in the face of Donald Trump’s past promise to cut off those cities from federal funding. \n \n In sanctuary cities, local law enforcement officials aren’t required to alert U.S. Immigration and Customs authorities about the immigration status of individuals with whom they come in contact. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n On Monday, Chicago's elected officials, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, are expected to hold a news conference to formally discuss how the city will retain its sanctuary status. Aldermen are expected to call on Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner to pressure Trump to back off his vow to interfere with funding. \n \n “Across the country and in Chicago and Illinois ... young men and women [are] very distraught about this,” Chicago Alderman Danny Solis told POLITICO Illinois on Sunday. \n \n Solis is among those planning to attend the news conference with Emanuel. \"There’s some people, though I disagree with them, but I have some respect for — Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus,\" Solis said, referring to the House speaker and the RNC chairman who will serve as Trump's chief of staff. \"I’m hoping that those guys have much more influence on Trump and what needs to be done not only on his first 100 days, but in his term.\" \n \n Illinois Comptroller-elect Susana Mendoza, whose parents are Mexican immigrants, called on Rauner to take a stand on the issue. \n \n “As a leader of this state, the governor, and everyone in a leadership position, should be saying it’s wrong,” Mendoza told POLITICO Illinois on Sunday. “I would expect that the governor would say, ‘that’s ridiculous.’ Besides moral bankruptcy, it’s bad fiscal policy for the city or any city.” \n \n The move is largely motivated by elected officials who say they’ve heard from terrified residents, including so-called Dreamers (children whose parents entered the country illegally), who fear imminent deportation. On Sunday, Emanuel’s office released a statement directing those with questions or in need of legal resources to call 311. \n \n “I want to assure all of our families that Chicago is and will remain a sanctuary city,” Emanuel said in a statement. “Chicago has been a city of immigrants since it was founded. We have always welcomed people of all faiths and backgrounds, and while the administration will change, our values and our commitment to inclusion will not.” \n \n Since Tuesday’s election, other cities that have affirmed their commitment to remaining sanctuaries include New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco. \n \n There are dozens of sanctuary cities in the United States and more than 100 jurisdictions have policies on the books that limit compliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n \n In a \"60 Minutes\" interview on Sunday, Trump vowed to deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants, but seemed to make a distinction between ones who had committed crimes — presumably beyond immigrating illegally — and ones who hadn't. \n \n “What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records -- gang members, drug dealers -- where a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,\" he said. \"But we’re getting them out of our country, they’re here illegally. \n \n “After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that. But before we make that determination, it’s very important, we are going to secure our border.” \n \n The immigration issue was central to Trump’s candidacy, framed by his pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. \n \n Neither Trump nor Rauner spokespeople responded to request for comment on Sunday. ||||| President-elect Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration stance was a central part of his campaign message in 2016 -- and he said in an interview Sunday that he plans to immediately deport approximately 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants. \n \n “What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,” Trump said in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes.” “But we’re getting them out of our country, they’re here illegally.” \n \n He continued by saying that after the border is “secure,” immigration officials will begin to make a “determination” about the remaining undocumented immigrants in the U.S. \n \n 60 Minutes interview: President-elect Donald Trump \n \n “After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that,” he said. “But before we make that determination...it’s very important, we are going to secure our border.” \n \n Asked whether he really plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border -- a proposal that served as a centerpiece of his campaign message -- Trump replied, “Yes.” \n \n Since Trump’s election on Tuesday night, the realities of actually building that wall have begun to set in. The Mexican government has publicly reminded him that Mexico will not pay for the wall. And asked about the wall, Trump transition co-chair Newt Gingrich said the wall was “a great campaign device.” \n \n Trump also told “60 Minutes” that the border wall, which was one of the centerpieces of his campaign platform, could be part wall and “some fencing,” in accordance with what congressional Republicans have proposed. \n \n “For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,” he said. “I’m very good at this, it’s called construction.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

They’ve pledged allegiance to the flag.” \n \n Nick Ut / AP ID: 9982132 \n \n He did not address the issue of protecting their information, which has some beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program concerned. \n \n Obama said that if they have DACA, which also gave them permission to work, “they’re solid, wonderful young people.” \n \n Trump has pledged to end DACA, calling it “one of the most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a president.” \n \n \n \n More than 700,000 young immigrants were shielded from deportation and received work permits under Obama’s 2012 executive actions. \n \n \n \n “It is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again,” Obama said, “and that’s something that I will encourage the president-elect to look at.” ||||| Did Rural American Farmers Vote To Deport Their Workforce? \n \n At the ballot box, rural Americans were unfazed by what would seem a contradictory choice: voting to remove the low-wage workers that are, arguably, the linchpin of the rural economy. Farming is a high risk, low margin business endeavor, largely propped up by government subsidies and a marginalized workforce willing to toil 80 hours a week at appallingly low rates of pay – employment conditions which few American-born citizens would accept. \n \n Apparently rural voters were willing to overlook this inconvenient truth, or perhaps they assume that Trump will not follow through on his promises. \n \n Voter Turnout in Urban vs. Rural Communities \n \n Trump won the vote in upwards of 90 percent of rural counties; in the 1,299 rural counties he won, he garnered 85 percent of the vote. In contrast, Hillary Clinton, who supported a path to citizenship for the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented workers, won close to 90 percent of urban counties. \n \n How Farmworkers Are Reacting \n \n Unsurprisingly, millions of undocumented farmworkers are in a state of panic. \n \n KION, a radio station in Monterrey County, California, where an estimated 55,000 undocumented workers tend to vast expanses of lettuce and strawberry fields, reported widespread concern. “I’m really scared,” said one farmworker who was interviewed. “Me and my roommate already have our truck loaded and ready to leave.” \n \n Elsewhere in California, Latino immigrants took to the streets to voice their opposition to the president-elect. The day after the election, a group of protesters in downtown Los Angeles shouted, “Aqui estamos y no nos vamos,” or, “We are here and we are not leaving,” according to Voices of America, a US-based news service that broadcasts in 45 languages. “I’m afraid for my family… our friends and for my coworkers,” said one protester. “Our status and our way of life in this country are in limbo,” said another. \n \n But Is It Possible? \n \n Many immigration experts have said Trump’s mass deportation plan is implausible, and would likely be ineffective at reversing the tide of immigrants from south of the border. The Trump campaign has even acknowledged that his initial statements on deportation may have been more bluster than substance. More likely than rounding up all 11 million illegal immigrants, is that Trump would reverse DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), President Obama’s executive order, which granted legal status – and a work permit – to immigrants who entered the country illegally prior to their 16th birthday. \n \n The paper trail associated with DACA workers would make them easy targets for deportation, compared to the millions of undocumented workers hiding in the shadows. \n \n Over 1 million young illegal immigrants, the vast majority from Mexico, have been approved for DACA benefits since the program began in 2012. DACA does not provide a path to citizenship, but was intended as an interim reprieve while democrat and republican members of Congress battled over immigration reform, a battle which pro-reform democrats ultimately lost. Because DACA is an executive order, which means it did not require congressional approval to be enacted, President-elect Trump could overturn it on his first day in office without recourse – a campaign promise that he has not backed down from. The paper trail associated with DACA workers would make them easy targets for deportation, compared to the millions of undocumented workers hiding in the shadows. \n \n Not that there won’t be intense political pressure from a coalition of immigrant rights groups to soften Trump’s anti-immigrant stance. The United Farm Workers, a Latino agricultural union based in California, which also advocates nationally on behalf of immigrant farm workers, will no doubt be one of those, leveraging its deep ties in Washington – UFW worked closely with the Obama administration and Clinton campaign on immigration reform – to block the president-elect’s deportation efforts. \n \n What Does the UFW Think? \n \n In an emailed statement to Modern Farmer on the day after the election, Arturo Rodriguez, who took over as UFW president following the death of founder Cesar Chavez in 1993, said: \n \n “Making progress will be more difficult, but our practice of organizing for the long term will let us continue to win justice… We reaffirm our confidence in the American people and in our Si Se Puede! attitude… As the challenges increase so does our commitment and determination to afford all farm workers and low-income working families the opportunities and respect they deserve.† \n \n Rodriguez, who also spoke with us just prior to the election about his hopes for the next president, did note one bright spot on the night of Novermber 8th: Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona (where Phoenix is located), who is known for his unrelenting persecution of Mexican immigrants, was not re-elected. He was seeking his seventh term. Recently referred to as the Donald Trump of Arizona, Arpaio has long been loathed by immigrant activists and progressive Americans alike as a symbol of xenophobic sentiment within the American political and law enforcement system. \n \n “We have confronted and overcome political adversity many times before,” said Rodriguez in his statement. “What remains unchanged is faith in our history and practice of organizing for the long term, running the race as a marathon and not just as a sprint. That faith will allow us to continue to win justice.” May it be so. ||||| Donald Trump wants to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. One problem: There almost certainly aren’t that many people who fit those criteria. \n \n In a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday, Trump said he would prioritize deporting or incarcerating the immigrants who are both in the country illegally and who are “gang members, drug dealers” or have other criminal convictions. He said there are “a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million.” \n \n It isn’t clear where Trump came up with those numbers. But according to the Department of Homeland Security, there are roughly 1.9 million non-citizen immigrants who have been convicted of crimes and are subject to deportation — what the government calls “removable criminal aliens.” That total, however, includes both undocumented immigrants and noncitizens in the country legally. The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, estimates that there are roughly 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally and that approximately 820,000 of them have criminal records. (The Migration Policy Institute doesn’t take positions on specific legislation but is generally seen as favoring immigration. The Pew Research Center, another think tank, comes up with a similar figure for the total number of undocumented immigrants.) Some of those immigrants are already incarcerated: A recent report from the Congressional Research Service estimated that at the end of 2013, there were more than 140,000 non-citizen immigrants in local, state and federal prisons and jails. (That figure includes people who are in the country legally, not all of whom are subject to deportation.) \n \n Beyond the specific numbers, the policy that Trump outlined Sunday is similar to the one President Obama pursued in his first term. When Obama first took office, he prioritized deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions, in some cases even for comparatively minor violations such as traffic offenses or shoplifting, according to Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute. Partly as a result, deportations soared under Obama, topping 400,000 in 2012. \n \n More recently, however, the Obama administration has changed tack, focusing instead on deporting immigrants convicted of more serious crimes or for repeat offenses. (He has also consistently deported undocumented immigrants who entered the country recently.) Deportations have fallen steadily in Obama’s second term, to below 250,000 in 2015. \n \n Capps said that the Homeland Security Department still has the resources it had in Obama’s first term. From a practical standpoint, then, it wouldn’t be hard for the government to deport 400,000 or even 500,000 people per year — meaning that Trump could credibly deport 2 million people during his first term without requiring additional resources or authorization from Congress. Many, but not all, of the people deported would be convicted criminals. \n \n “It would not be hard to get up to 2 million in four years, and most of them would be quote-unquote criminals,” Capps said, although he added that many of those criminal convictions would be for relatively minor crimes. \n \n Trump is also likely to roll back a central element of Obama’s immigration agenda: his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offers temporary legal status to people who entered the country illegally as children. During the campaign, Trump pledged to end DACA, but he hasn’t said how — whether he will close the program to new applicants, allow it to expire or end it even for the roughly three-quarters of a million people who have been granted legal status under the program. \n \n “The proof is going to be in what his administration actually does,” Capps said, “and it will take some time before we know that.”",
    "summary": "– In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes on Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump said his first priority will be arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records, and he put a number to the effort: \"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate.\" How does that number hold up, and what's the reaction been? The rundown: Washington Post's Fact Checker and FiveThirtyEight find Trump comes up short. While a rep for the president-elect called out a Department of Homeland Security report that cited 1.9 million \"removable criminal aliens\" as of fiscal year 2013, both point out that phrase also includes lawful permanent residents and those with temporary visas, meaning size of the group Trump was referring to is south of that 1.9 million. Both also cite the number 820,000—the Migration Policy Institute's estimate of undocumented immigrants with criminal records. In his first press conference since the election, President Obama addressed the topic of young undocumented immigrants and advised Trump to \"think long and hard\" before endangering their status. BuzzFeed has more. Trump won't find an ally among the LAPD. \"We are not going to work in conjunction with Homeland Security on deportation efforts,\" Police Chief Charlie Beck tells the LA Times, continuing the department's decades-old stance. Los Angeles is a \"sanctuary city\"—meaning ones where police and city workers aren’t obligated to turn undocumented immigrants they encounter into the feds, per Politico—and it's not alone. NPR reports there are 300 such cities and counties, and under Trump's First 100 Days plan they stand to lose federal funding if they don't change their tune. That didn't scare Mayor Rahm Emmanuel, who on Monday emphasized Chicago \"always will be a sanctuary city.\" Modern Farmer looks into one of the \"great ironies in the election\": that rural Americans voted for a candidate whose immigration policies could decimate the agricultural workforce."

(Associated Press) \n \n TORONTO (AP) — Police arrested six students from a prestigious private all-boys Catholic school in Toronto on Monday and charged them with sexual assault related to a video that was posted on the internet. \n \n Toronto Police Inspector Dominic Sinopoli said the teens, who are all 14 and 15, are from St. Michael's College and were charged with assault, gang sexual assault and sexual assault with a weapon. \n \n The high school is known for its sports programs and has produced many National Hockey League players over the years. \n \n Sinopoli said the school failed to notify police immediately and police became aware of the sexual assault through the media. Police are investigating at least three other hazing incidents, including another alleged sexual assault. \n \n Those arrested are young offenders and cannot be named.

Five students turned themselves in to police and one was arrested on his way to school, Deputy Chief James Ramer and Insp. Domenic Sinopoli of the sex crimes unit told reporters at a Monday morning news conference at Toronto police headquarters. \n \n Toronto police Inspt. Domenic Sinopoli announces criminal charges at a Monday news conference against six students of St. Michael’s College School. Rick Madonik/Toronto Star ( Rick Madonik / Toronto Star ) \n \n The six boys have each been charged with assault, gang sexual assault and sexual assault with a weapon, Sinopoli said. Their charges are all in relation to a single incident that was captured on video and posted to social media depicting an alleged sexual assault of a teen boy. The 22-second video, which has been viewed by the Star, shows the teen held down by a group of boys in a locker room while he is allegedly sexually assaulted with what appears to be a broomstick. \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n As the graphic allegations were read out in a small Toronto courtroom Monday afternoon, some of the parents of the accused teens began crying. The teens appeared distraught and hunched forward in the prisoners’ box as Crown Erin McNamara described what allegedly occurred. Two shook their heads at certain points. All six were released with the consent of the Crown with their parents as sureties. Two of the teens were released on $7,000 bail, with the other four on $5,000 bail. Their conditions of release include not contacting or being near the complainant, not going to St. Michael’s College School and only using social media with the “direct and constant supervision” of their sureties. \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n Police are also investigating at least three other incidents at the school, one an alleged sexual assault and two alleged assaults. There are “a minimum of four victims,” Sinopoli said. “We also know there are several videos being circulated,” said Sinopoli, adding police are concerned the videos may still be being shared online. Police have warned that anyone in possession of the alleged sex assault video should delete it immediately because it meets the definition of child pornography. The news conference was briefly delayed after a bomb threat was called in to the school Monday morning, police said. The Roman Catholic school expelled eight students and suspended another one in connection with at least two incidents that allegedly took place on campus and were captured on video. Late last week, the alleged sex assault video and another video began circulating on social media sites. \n \n Six teens have been arrested and charged after an alleged sexual assault at St. Michael’s private school in Toronto. Police say anyone in possession of the video of the alleged incident should delete it immediately. (The Canadian Press) \n \n The Star also viewed the second, 49-second video, shot in the boys’ washroom. It shows a young boy in his underwear — he appears not to be physically injured — placed in a large sink by other boys, who splash water on him and slap him. At a late afternoon news conference at the school, principal Greg Reeves told reporters it’s clear St. Michael’s College School has “a serious problem.” “As a school we have a responsibility to keep our students safe, but our collective best efforts, have failed,” he said. Pressed by reporters, he said he didn’t call police about the video of the alleged sexual assault in the locker room, which he saw Monday evening. When police arrived at the school Wednesday he said he told them about it, but was always intending to call them. Sinopoli said Reeves had called police Monday for advice related to a hazing incident, but there “was never really a complaint” until after police heard about the video from the media. After days of questions about who knew what and when, the school released a detailed timeline of events late last week, confirming officials took a full day to report the locker room video to police. \n \n Reeves told the Star in an interview Sunday evening that the delay was because he was busy with expulsion meetings related to the washroom video on Tuesday. The mother of the locker room victim was out of town and he set up a meeting with both parents for Wednesday. “My whole focus was on the protection of this young man,” Reeves said. At the police news conference, Sinopoli said the school should have immediately notified police about the alleged sex assault video. Reeves said at the Monday news conference that when he saw the video he called the victim’s dad, and his mom was out of town. Neither had been informed by their son. The victim was his priority, Reeves said. “I know I’m being criticized for that, but I’ve spoken with the victim’s parents, they are very pleased with the timeline, and I think that we’re helping the healing of that victim,” Reeves said. Reeves said the school is co-operating with police. He said a confidential voice mail has been set up and a full-time social worker is being hired. Last week, the school did its own internal investigations into both the locker room and bathroom videos, brought in crisis counsellors, and met with members of the junior football team and their parents. “There’s no good news in this story whatsoever,” Mayor John Tory told reporters at city hall after news of the students’ charges. “This is a school that has a great history, a great distinguished history in our city, but sometimes it can be the case that cultures within organizations like that — not confined to that school or schools in general — can fail to meet the accepted standard or fail to keep up even with changing attitudes.” Tory said he couldn’t comment on the timing of when police were notified about the alleged incidents. “The police should be called in instances where there is suspected criminal conduct as soon as possible,” he said, adding it was best left to others to examine what happened in this case. Over the weekend, the elite all-boys school announced an independent third-party investigation into the school’s culture. The “SMCS Respect and Culture Review” will look at the traditions, rituals and social practices of students. Parents and alumni will also be consulted. It will be led by a three-member independent committee of prominent citizens individuals who don’t have any connection to the school and a final report is expected by the summer. Recommendations will be implemented by the start of the 2019-20 school year. It looks as if you appreciate our journalism. Our reporting changes lives, connects communities and effects change.

They completed the difficult journey to find Pattaya Beach flooded, so swam on and found the boys about 400m away. \n \n How can they get out? \n \n Bringing the trapped boys to safety is an extremely dangerous task given the conditions inside. \n \n The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season which lasts until September or October. \n \n Image copyright Facebook/ekatol Image caption A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the missing children \n \n Experts have cautioned that taking inexperienced divers through the dangerous corridors of muddy, zero-visibility waters would be very risky. \n \n Diver Ben Reymenants, who is assisting with the rescue mission, told the BBC that two Thai navy doctors had volunteered to stay with the boys for \"up to four months\" until the water receded. \n \n Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into the cave. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Diver Ben Reymenants is assisting with the rescue mission and says none of the boys can swim \n \n Who are they? \n \n The 12 boys are all members of a local football team and their coach is known to have taken them on occasional excursions and field trips. \n \n Tinnakorn Boonpiem, whose 12-year-old son Mongkol is among the 13, told Agence France-Presse she was \"so glad\" to hear they were safe. \n \n \"I want him to be physically and mentally fit,\" she said. \n \n \"I'm so happy I can't put it into words,\" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. ||||| Family members of the 12 boys and their soccer coach react after they were found alive, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, in northern Thailand, Tuesday, July 3, 2018.

Narongsak Osatanakorn said Tuesday morning that a navy SEAL team will make the final call on the evacuation method. He said one method being considered is for the group to be coached to swim using special breathing masks. \n \n He said other efforts will continue, such as draining water from the cave and exploring the mountainside for shafts and other entrances to the caverns below. \n \n Experts have said the safest option could be to supply the 12 boys and their coach where they are and wait for the water levels to drop. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:30 a.m. \n \n A Thai provincial governor says the 13 people who had been missing for more than a week have all had an \"informal\" medical evaluation inside the cave and most are in stable condition and none are in critical condition. \n \n Chiang Rai Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said Tuesday morning that they used a field assessment in which red is critical condition, yellow is serious condition and green is stable condition. \n \n He said: \"We found that most of the boys are in green condition. Maybe some of the boys have injuries or light injuries and would be categorized as yellow condition. But no one is in red condition.\" \n \n The 12 boys and their soccer coach were found late Monday still in the cave and it is not known when they will be able to leave due to flooding and other factors. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:50 p.m. \n \n A leading American cave rescue expert says many challenges are ahead for rescue divers in Thailand who located the 12 boys and their soccer coach who had been missing in a cave for more than a week. \n \n Anmar Mirza, the U.S. National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator, says the primary decision is now one of whether to try to evacuate them or to supply them in place. \n \n He says \"supplying them on site may face challenges depending on how difficult the dives are. Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy.\" \n \n He says that \"if the dives are difficult then supply will be difficult, but the risk of trying to dive them out is also exponentially greater.\" \n \n Rescuers located the boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach alive deep inside the partially flooded cave in northern Thailand late Monday. They disappeared when flooding trapped them after entering the cave on June 23. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:40 p.m. \n \n Thailand's prime minister has thanked international experts and rescuers who helped find the 12 boys and their soccer coach who had been missing in a cave for more than a week. \n \n The Prime Minister's Office says Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha \"wishes to thank the tremendous efforts of all international units that have come to assist the Thai authorities in rescuing the youth football team that was stuck in the caves in Chiang Rai. The Royal Thai Government and the Thai people are grateful for this support and cooperation, and we all wish the team a safe and speedy recovery.\" \n \n Rescuers located the boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach alive deep inside the partially flooded cave in northern Thailand late Monday. They disappeared when flooding trapped them after entering the cave on June 23. \n \n ___ \n \n 11 p.m. \n \n A Thai provincial governor says all 12 boys and their coach have been found alive in the cave where they went missing over a week ago in northern Thailand. \n \n Chiang Rai Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said late Monday that the 13 were being rescued. \n \n He said, \"We found them safe. But the operation isn't over.\" \n \n The boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing when flooding trapped them after entering the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai province on June 23.",
    "summary": "– The discovery of 12 Thai boys and their coach still alive after 10 days trapped in a flooded cave has brought massive relief to their families and an anxious nation—but the military warns that their ordeal could be only just beginning. The group, discovered by two British divers late Monday, are on a dry rock ledge around 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave, and the Thai military says it could be months before it can get them out, unless the boys learn to dive, the BBC reports. The cave in northern Thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in September or October, meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months. Experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys, ages 11 to 16, to safety through miles of dark, narrow, flooded tunnels. \"Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy,\" US National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator Anmar Mirza tells the AP. Thai officials say they're committed to \"100% safety\" and will continue to explore their options, including draining water from the cave system and searching for shafts that could provide an alternative escape route. Officials say the boys are hungry and weak but in stable medical condition with only minor injuries. They have been provided with high-protein liquid food and will be given more supplies and visited by doctors in the days to come."

    "document": "Talcum Powder and Cancer \n \n What is talcum powder? \n \n Talcum powder is made from talc, a mineral made up mainly of the elements magnesium, silicon, and oxygen. As a powder, it absorbs moisture well and helps cut down on friction, making it useful for keeping skin dry and helping to prevent rashes. It is widely used in cosmetic products such as baby powder and adult body and facial powders, as well as in a number of other consumer products. \n \n In its natural form, some talc contains asbestos, a substance known to cause cancers in and around the lungs when inhaled (see our document Asbestos). All talcum products used in homes in the United States have been asbestos-free since the 1970s. \n \n Most concerns about a possible link between talcum powder and cancer have been focused on: \n \n Whether people who have long-term exposure to natural talc fibers at work, such as talc miners, are at higher risk of lung cancer from breathing them in. \n \n Whether women who apply talcum powder regularly in the genital area have an increased risk of ovarian cancer. \n \n Does talcum powder cause cancer? \n \n When talking about whether or not talcum powder is linked to cancer, it is important to distinguish between talc that contains asbestos and talc that is asbestos-free. Talc that has asbestos is generally accepted as being able to cause cancer if it is inhaled. This type of talc is not used in modern consumer products. The evidence about asbestos-free talc, which is still widely used, is less clear. \n \n Researchers use 2 main types of studies to try to figure out if a substance or exposure causes cancer. \n \n Lab studies: In studies done in the lab, animals are exposed to a substance (often in very large doses) to see if it causes tumors or other health problems. Researchers might also expose normal cells in a lab dish to the substance to see if it causes the types of changes that are seen in cancer cells. It’s not always clear if the results from these types of studies will apply to humans, but lab studies are a good way to find out if a substance might possibly cause cancer. \n \n Studies in people: Another type of study looks at cancer rates in different groups of people. Such a study might compare the cancer rate in a group exposed to a substance to the rate in a group not exposed to it, or compare it to what the expected cancer rate would be in the general population. But sometimes it can be hard to know what the results of these studies mean, because many other factors might affect the results. \n \n In most cases neither type of study provides enough evidence on its own, so researchers usually look at both lab-based and human and studies when trying to figure out if something causes cancer. \n \n Studies in the lab \n \n Studies that exposed lab animals (rats, mice, and hamsters) to asbestos-free talc in various ways have had mixed results, with some showing tumor formation and others not finding any. \n \n Studies in people \n \n Ovarian cancer \n \n It has been suggested that talcum powder might cause cancer in the ovaries if the powder particles (applied to the genital area or on sanitary napkins, diaphragms, or condoms) were to travel through the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes to the ovary. \n \n Many studies in women have looked at the possible link between talcum powder and cancer of the ovary. Findings have been mixed, with some studies reporting a slightly increased risk and some reporting no increase. Many case-control studies have found a small increase in risk. But these types of studies can be biased because they often rely on a person’s memory of talc use many years earlier. Two prospective cohort studies, which would not have the same type of potential bias, have not found an increased risk. \n \n For any individual woman, if there is an increased risk, the overall increase is likely to very be small. Still, talc is widely used in many products, so it is important to determine if the increased risk is real. Research in this area continues. \n \n Lung cancer \n \n Some studies of talc miners and millers have suggested an increased risk of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, while others have found no increase in lung cancer risk. These studies have been complicated by the fact that talc in its natural form can contain varying amounts of asbestos and other minerals, unlike the purified talc in consumer products. When working underground, miners can also be exposed to other substances that might affect lung cancer risk, such as radon. \n \n No increased risk of lung cancer has been reported with the use of cosmetic talcum powder. \n \n Other cancers \n \n Talc use has not been strongly linked to other cancers, although not all possible links with other cancers have been studied extensively. \n \n One study suggested genital talcum powder use may slightly increase the risk of endometrial (uterine) cancer in women who are past menopause. But other studies have not found such a link. Further studies are needed to explore this topic. \n \n Some limited research has also looked at a possible link between inhaled talc exposure at work and other cancers, such as stomach cancer. But there is no strong evidence of such links at this time. \n \n What expert agencies say \n \n Several national and international agencies study substances in the environment to determine if they can cause cancer. (A substance that causes cancer or helps cancer grow is called a carcinogen.) The American Cancer Society looks to these organizations to evaluate the risks based on evidence from laboratory, animal, and human research studies. \n \n The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). Its major goal is to identify causes of cancer. \n \n IARC classifies talc that contains asbestos as “carcinogenic to humans.” \n \n Based on the lack of data from human studies and on limited data in lab animal studies, IARC classifies inhaled talc not containing asbestos as “not classifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans.” \n \n Based on limited evidence from human studies of a link to ovarian cancer, IARC classifies the perineal (genital) use of talc-based body powder as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” \n \n The US National Toxicology Program (NTP) is formed from parts of several different government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NTP has not fully reviewed talc (with or without asbestos) as a possible carcinogen. \n \n (For more information on the classification systems used by these agencies, see our document Known and Probable Human Carcinogens.) \n \n Can I reduce my exposure to talcum powder? \n \n It is not clear if consumer products containing talcum powder increase cancer risk. Studies of personal use of talcum powder have had mixed results, although there is some suggestion of a possible increase in ovarian cancer risk. There is very little evidence at this time that any other forms of cancer are linked with consumer use of talcum powder. \n \n Until more information is available, people concerned about using talcum powder may want to avoid or limit their use of consumer products that contain it. \n \n Additional resources \n \n More information from your American Cancer Society \n \n The following related information may also be helpful to you.

She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. The suit accused Johnson & Johnson of \"negligent conduct\" in making and marketing its baby powder. \n \n \"We are pleased the jury did the right thing,\" said Jim Onder, an attorney for the plaintiff. \"They once again reaffirmed the need for Johnson & Johnson to warn the public of the ovarian cancer risk associated with its product.\" \n \n Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman with Johnson & Johnson, could not immediately be reached for comment. In a statement provided to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, she said: \"We deeply sympathize with the women and families impacted by ovarian cancer. We will appeal today's verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder.\" \n \n Earlier this year, two other lawsuits in St. Louis ended in jury verdicts worth a combined $127 million. But two others in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said there wasn't reliable evidence that talc leads to ovarian cancer, an often fatal but relatively rare form of cancer. Ovarian cancer accounts for about 22,000 of the 1.7 million new cases of cancer expected to be diagnosed in the U.S. this year. \n \n About 2,000 women have filed similar suits, and lawyers are reviewing thousands of other potential cases, most generated by ads touting the two big verdicts out of St. Louis — a $72 million award in February to relatives of an Alabama woman who died of ovarian cancer, and a $55 million award in May to a South Dakota survivor of the disease. \n \n Much research has found no link or a weak one between ovarian cancer and using baby powder for feminine hygiene, and most major health groups have declared talc harmless. Johnson & Johnson, whose baby powder dominates the market, maintains it's perfectly safe. \n \n But Onder of the Onder Law Firm in suburban St. Louis, which represented plaintiffs in all three St. Louis cases, cited other research that began connecting talcum powder to ovarian cancer in the 1970s. He said case studies have indicated that women who regularly use talc on their genital area face up to a 40 percent higher risk of developing ovarian cancer. ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Johnson & Johnson lost a third straight trial over claims its talcum powder can cause ovarian cancer with a St. Louis jury awarding a California woman more than $70 million. \n \n J&J is accused in about 1,700 lawsuits in state and federal court of ignoring studies linking its baby powder and Shower-to-Shower talc products to ovarian cancer and failing to warn customers about the risk. Thursday’s verdict follows damages verdicts of $72 million and $55 million against the company this year in the first two talc claims to go to trial in St. Louis. Both are being appealed. \n \n Deborah Giannecchini, 62, used J&J’s baby powder for feminine hygiene for more than four decades until her diagnosis with ovarian cancer three years ago, according to her lawyers. She has an 80 percent chance of dying in the next two years, and has undergone surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, they said. \n \n A J&J unit was ordered to pay $65 million in punitive damages and 90 percent of about $2.5 million for medical costs and pain and suffering. Co-defendant Imerys Talc America, the supplier of the talc, was hit with $2.5 million in punitive damages. Jurors returned the verdict after deliberating for about three hours. \n \n The company should have provided a warning label on the product to let consumers decide whether to use talc, one juror Billie Ray, 76, of St. Louis, said after the trial. “It seemed like Johnson & Johnson didn’t pay attention,” she said. “It seemed like they didn’t care.” \n \n Giannecchini appeared overwhelmed by the verdict. “I’ve waited for a long time for this,” she said. “I’ve wanted this so badly.” \n \n J&J will appeal, said Carol Goodrich, company spokeswoman. “We are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder,” she said in a statement. \n \n Imerys ‘Disappointed’ \n \n Imerys is “disappointed’’ with the verdict, said Dan Rene, a company spokesman. Imerys had been cleared in the two prior St. Louis trials, as well as in two claims dismissed in New Jersey, Rene said in a statement. \n \n “This verdict serves to undermine efforts by the scientific community to determine the true causes of ovarian cancer,’’ Rene said. “The theories relied upon by plaintiffs’ experts lacked scientific foundation.’’ \n \n J&J is facing hundreds of claims in St. Louis state court, which has become a magnet for plaintiffs’ product defect claims, as well as about 300 suits in Los Angeles, another 200 in New Jersey and a growing number of federal cases combined before one judge in that state. A New Jersey state court judge last month threw out two talc cases set for trial, finding inadequate scientific support for the claims. \n \n JNJ has denied any link to talc use and ovarian cancer. \n \n “Science, research, clinical evidence and decades of studies by medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of cosmetic talc,’’ Goodrich said before the verdict. The New Jersey dismissal decision “highlights the lack of scientific evidence behind plaintiffs’ allegations,” she said. \n \n Risk Known \n \n J&J was aware of “30 years of studies showing an increased risk of ovarian cancer from the use of talc,” Giannecchini’s lawyer, Allen Smith, told jurors in the St. Louis trial. “They knew, and they knew the public was unaware of the risk.” Instead of adding warning labels, J&J “developed a defense strategy to prevent government regulation of its products,” he said. \n \n “I think the jury heard our message loud and clear,” Smith said after the verdict. “If this doesn’t send a message to J&J to add a warning, I don’t know what will.” \n \n The case is Hogans v. Johnson & Johnson, 1422-CC09012-01, Circuit Court, St. Louis City, Missouri (St. Louis).",
    "summary": "– For more than 40 years, Deborah Giannecchini used Johnson & Johnson baby powder and other talcum powder products—and on Thursday, a St. Louis jury awarded more than $70 million in damages on her claim, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The 63-year-old Californian said those J&J products contributed to her developing ovarian cancer. The jury voted against J&J 10-2—one of the dissenters actually didn't think the award was enough—with an award of $575,000 in medical damages, $2 million in compensatory damages, $2.5 million in compensatory damages against Imerys Talc (the producer of the talcum powder), and $65 million in punitive damages against J&J. About half of the punitive damages will go to the Missouri Crime Victims' Compensation Program, per Jim Onder of Onder Law, which has handled all three cases with awarded damages so far. Memos from inside J&J show the company knew for decades about research tying the use of talc powder to ovarian cancer, Onder says—though CNBC says \"much\" of that research has been \"weak.\" Giannecchini, however, had no clue of possible risks. \"There isn't a way to describe how you feel ... when you're told you probably won't make it beyond the next year,\" she says of receiving her stage 4 cancer diagnosis in 2012. Per her lawyers, Giannecchini has about an 80% chance of dying within the next two years, Bloomberg reports. Not that Onder expects J&J to cede to the nearly 2,000 state and federal complaints against it; instead, he believes the company will take a \"scorched-earth legal policy\" and not settle \"until they absolutely have to.\" In a statement, a J&J rep says the company will appeal because it's \"guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder.\""

    "document": "FLINT (WWJ/AP) – Flint’s lead toxicity problem has now apparently spread to animals. \n \n Officials are reminding people to make sure pets aren’t drinking unfiltered Flint tap water after two area dogs recently tested positive for lead toxicity. It’s the state’s first lead toxicity cases involving dogs in five years. \n \n “Here in Michigan, specifically in Genesse County, we’ve had two cases of high-lead levels reported to us in dogs in the last six months,” State Veterinarian Dr. James Averill told WWJ’s Chrystal Knight. “One was last fall and one was here in January. … One was a stray dog and the other was a family animal.” \n \n Both dogs are still alive, although officials haven’t disclosed whether the dogs were drinking Flint water, how much lead was in their systems or what symptoms they were showing. \n \n “There is no regular testing for lead,” said Averill. “What we do is we rely on the veterinarians who have the boots on the ground that are interacting with their clients and looking at the patients in front of them. When they are concerned or suspect a lead toxicity may be possible, they let us know at that time and then we work with them moving forward from there.” \n \n Averill said the “vast majority” of tests for lead in dogs in the area have been negative amid Flint’s crisis with lead-tainted water. \n \n “Dogs are at a higher risk amongst mammals for finding high lead levels, but it’s not that common. Typically for us when we deal with lead toxicity, we’re usually dealing with cattle. So, really this was a new instance for us,” he said. \n \n To protect your pets, Averill said residents in Genesee County should “do what you are doing for yourself for your pet.” \n \n “So number one, get your water tested to see if you have high lead levels. Two, if necessary, get a filter in place and then water your pets through that filtered water,” he said. “Take the same steps that you would for yourself for your pets.” \n \n Averill said the first sign that your pet might be suffering from lead poisoning is any deviation from their normal behavior. \n \n “I think the key thing is, as pet owners you know what is the normal routine for your pet,” he said. “So what pet owners need to be looking for is the animal having their normal behavior in their normal routine, as they are creatures of habit.” \n \n The next step would be bringing your concerns to a local veterinarian, who can further decode what is going on with your pet. \n \n “The signs and symptoms of lead toxicity are very broad and general, and similar to so many other diseases that a veterinarian needs to work up the case and do things to determine if it’s lead toxicity or if it’s something else,” said Averill. “For example, vomiting can be caused by many things. So it’s really critical that people work with a veterinarian when a pet has gone outside their normal routine.” \n \n Anyone who notices their pets acting strangely is encouraged to take them to a veterinarian. \n \n TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

(Photo: Romain Blanquart Detroit Free Press) \n \n DETROIT — Two dogs in the Flint area recently tested positive for lead toxicity, according to the state veterinarian. \n \n The dogs with lead toxicity are both cross-breeds, and they're both still alive, said Dr. James Averill, state veterinarian and Animal Industry Division Director for the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. One is a pet, and the other was a stray. Their test results were confirmed in October 2015 and January 2016, but state officials declined to release further details about the cases — including whether they live in Flint. \n \n Both were in Genesee County, where high levels of the heavy metal in Flint's tap water system are a major crisis. Officials in Flint continue to advise that people and their pets avoid drinking unfiltered tap water. \n \n \"The confidentiality of the owners is like medical information in humans,\" Averill said. \n \n These were the first two dogs to be confirmed with lead toxicity in the past five years, according to state records. Officials have not disclosed whether they were drinking Flint water, how much lead was in their systems, what symptoms they were showing, their weight or how old they are. \n \n Dr. James Averill, State Veterinarian within MDARD's Animal Industry Division. (Photo: Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) \n \n \"(The state) does provide reportable disease/condition case information down to the county level, but cannot provide the specifics of those individual cases,\" according to an email from Jennifer Holton, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The email cites the Animal Industry Act of 1988 for keeping information in the cases hidden from the public. \n \n The state is in contact with area veterinarians, and the \"vast majority\" of tests for lead in dogs has been negative, Averill said. But people who notice their pets acting unusual are encouraged to see their veterinarian. \n \n If a veterinarian determines a dog may have lead toxicity, the lab testing is provided free of charge, he said. And the number of requests has been increasing. But Averill also said that symptoms can vary widely. \n \n \"The thing with lead toxicity in animals, their clinical signs, they're so similar to so many other diseases,\" he said. \n \n Dr. Michael Merrithew, a veterinarian for about 43 years, works at Veterinary House Call Services and Clinic in Grand Blanc, near Flint. He said he's not seen any recent cases he'd attribute to lead, but he's told his staff to watch for symptoms. \n \n Among the possibilities, \"mental dullness,\" possibly arthritis, \"probably general malaise first,\" he said. \n \n Averill said to watch for deviations from routines. \n \n \"My dog, when I get up in the morning, the first thing he wants to do is get up and go to the bathroom,\" he said. \"(Pet owners) know their animals. And when they're not their normal selves, tell them to seek veterinary care.\" \n \n Dr. Lawrence Ehrman, a veterinarian for about 33 years, works at Veterinary Medical Hospital in Flint Township. He also said he doesn't appear to have had any recent patients with lead toxicity, but lead poisoning from water can be more challenging to determine. \n \n \"What we're dealing with here is not like an acute poisoning. It's more a chronic sort of thing,\" he said. \"It can cause brain and mental issues, blood issues and even some digestive and kidney issues, though they're much less common.\" \n \n He said changes in attitude or signs of weakness could be symptoms of lead toxicity. \n \n Averill said it's OK to bathe pets in Flint's tap water, but they should only be drinking filtered or bottled water. Since 2011, all the other cases of lead in animals have involved cattle. \n \n Ehrman said that for people who don't immediately have bottled or filtered water available for their pets, there's an alternative. \n \n \"Probably melt some snow,\" he said. \"And it would be safer, if your only other choice is feeding them straight Flint water.\" \n \n Follow Robert Allen on Twitter: @rallenMI \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1X7hCq4",
    "summary": "– First it was the kids of Flint found to have been tainted by lead, attributed by many to the area's toxic water. Now two dogs who live in the vicinity of the Michigan city have tested positive for lead toxicity—the first two pups to be confirmed with this in state records in five years, the Detroit Free Press reports. \"Here in Michigan, specifically in [Genesee] County, we've had two cases of high-lead levels reported to us in dogs in the last six months,\" state vet Dr. James Averill tells CBS Detroit. \"One was last fall and one was here in January.\" He says that one of the affected dogs was a stray, while the other was a pet. Both dogs are alive, Averill notes, but the state report doesn't specify how high their lead levels were, or what symptoms they had. And indeed, it's challenging to diagnose dogs with lead toxicity, as symptoms such as \"mental dullness,\" arthritis, and lethargy can mimic those of other illnesses, Averill says. Instead, he mentions keeping an eye on variations in a pet's routine to help pinpoint if something's wrong. He does note to CBS, however, that the \"vast majority\" of lead tests on area dogs have come back negative, and he says they're relying on local veterinarians with \"boots on the ground\" to look out for suspicious cases. In the meantime, while Averill gives the OK to bathe pets in Flint-area tap water, he says they should be drinking filtered or bottled water or, as a last resort, melted snow. \"It would be safer, if your only other choice is feeding them straight Flint water,\" he notes. (The FBI's now on Flint's case.)"

    "document": "Kanye West was not placed on a 51-50 psychiatric hold before he was hospitalized for exhaustion, a source confirms to PEOPLE. \n \n Despite reports claiming that the rapper was committed against his will, a source tells PEOPLE: “There was a small altercation at the gym but he was deemed medically stable and decided to seek medical help at his doctor’s request.” \n \n The source adds: “We’re super confident he’s going to pull through.” \n \n PEOPLE confirmed that West, 39, was hospitalized for exhaustion on Monday afternoon after canceling his Saint Pablo tour. \n \n “He is exhausted and currently dealing with sleep deprivation,” a source told PEOPLE. “He went to the hospital at will under the advice of his physician. He’s fine.” \n \n The source added that “he was not restrained” and that “he went freely.” \n \n Last night, Kim Kardashian West was scheduled to attend the Angel Ball in New York City, but did not attend. It would have marked her first public appearance since she was robbed in Paris in early October. \n \n The source also told PEOPLE that Kardashian West is “being amazing” as his family and friends support his recovery. \n \n “Family and friends are around. Kim is being amazing. As are all of his friends and team and inner circle.” ||||| Kim Kardashian is standing by her man. \n \n Two days after Kanye West voluntarily admitted himself into a Los Angeles area hospital, E! News is learning more about how the Grammy winner's wife is being supportive during a difficult time. \n \n \"She is just holding things down like Kanye did for her when she needed support,\" a source shared with E! News exclusively. \"Kim is doing much better and is strong. This shall pass she believes.\" \n \n Before her husband was hospitalized, Kim was scheduled to make her first public appearance since the Paris robbery at the Angel Ball in New York City where her late father Robert Kardashian was being honored. \n \n She ended up canceling at the last minute and boarded a flight back to Los Angeles Monday evening allowing her to visit Kanye in person soon after. ||||| He'll need a doctor's note. \n \n Yesterday (Nov. 21), after a rep for Kanye West confirmed that the remaining 21 dates of his Saint Pablo Tour would be canceled, Billboard estimated it would result in the refunding of more than 300,000 tickets, worth $27.3 million. At the time, however, the big unknown was why West canceled the dates, leaving open the question of whether insurance would cover the costs of shutting down the tour. \n \n Last night, West was placed under observation at a Los Angeles-area hospital, and a source told Billboard he was suffering from exhaustion and sleep deprivation. And while there is little to no further information about West's condition or the specific reasoning for canceling the tour dates, exhaustion raises several possibilities in terms of West's potential financial liabilities. \n \n Assuming West had insurance for his Saint Pablo Tour, a standard policy within the music industry would cover an \"accident to or illness of any insured person which, in the opinion of an independent medical practitioner approved by the underwriters, entirely prevents any insured person from appearing or continuing to appear in any or all of the insured performances or events.\" \n \n Essentially, that would require a third party medical practitioner to determine whether or not West's exhaustion would physically allow him to continue. But it also would typically come with exclusions: for instance, if the exhaustion was due to drug use, sexually-transmitted diseases, \"unreasonable or capricious behavior\" -- which would include cancellations as a result of excessive partying or similar behavior -- and whether there was a pre-existing condition, meaning if the person had a history of exhaustion or a previously-diagnosed and undisclosed illness. \n \n A fairly textbook example of a situation that would be covered by this type of policy is Lady Gaga's 2013 Born This Way Ball Tour. With 22 dates to go on the trek, Gaga suffered a labral tear in her right hip that required surgery, forcing her to cancel the remaining shows on the tour and causing $25 million worth of ticket refunds. Gaga's injury clearly would have been covered by this type of insurance, including expenses related to shutting down the tour, advertising costs and lost revenues for both the promoter and performer. \n \n Again, however, West's situation is slightly different, and there is no clear answer. \n \n \"[The policy] is often invoked very quickly for specific injury or illness that is diagnosed easily,\" says Paul Bassman, president/CEO of Ascend Insurance Brokerage, one of the top insurance firms in the music industry. \"Exhaustion would definitely be harder to prove, but I wouldn't say it's impossible.\" \n \n Live Nation, the promoter for the Saint Pablo Tour, likely has its own policy, which generally differs from an artist's policy by not carrying exclusions for things like drug use, capricious behavior or other situations, though the independent medical evaluation would still be required. That could leave open a situation where Live Nation would be covered for its own expenses, including its guarantees to West (if they are responsible for paying those guarantees in the event of a cancellation), while if West's condition was not deemed to be covered by his insurance policy, he may still be on the hook. \n \n For now there is little to do but hope that West is getting the treatment he requires, while any definitive judgment is too early to assess. \"We just don't know enough about why he canceled,\" Bassman adds. \"Until more information is available on the specifics of the cancellation, it's not possible to determine whether this will be covered by insurance or not.\" ||||| Kanye West Psychosis Diagnosis May Trigger Huge Payout \n \n Kanye West's Psychosis Diagnosis May Trigger Huge Payout \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n Kanye West is dealing with a medical emergency, but there's a silver lining ... it may have saved him millions of dollars. \n \n Kanye announced the cancellation of his tour 6 hours before he was handcuffed to a stretcher and hauled off to UCLA Medical Center for psychiatric evaluation. \n \n The rapper not only reportedly lost around $30 mil for his cut of the remaining concerts, but he's on the hook for venues and others with whom he made contracts. \n \n TMZ has learned ... Kanye had an insurance policy that covered him in the event illness prevented him from performing. The policy provides the insurance carrier will pay Kanye for not only the money he'd make but the money he was obligated to pay others if \"accident or illness ... prevents any Insured Person from appearing or continuing to appear in any or all of the Insured Performance(s) or Event(s).\" \n \n Translation ... Kanye's doctor laid the groundwork for filing a claim under the policy. \n \n BTW ... the insurance company can deny coverage if Kanye had a preexisting condition that he didn't disclose at the time the policy was issued, or if his illness was caused by his \"unreasonable or capricious behavior.\"",
    "summary": "– Had Kanye West canceled his tour on a whim, he would have been on the hook for a massive amount of money owed to venues and anyone else with whom he broke a contract. But since he was taken to the hospital with a psychiatric emergency soon after canceling, his insurance policy may have saved him millions of dollars, TMZ reports. The policy covers him in the event an \"accident or illness\" prevents him from performing, so now he can file a claim to collect. It's not a slam dunk, as coverage can be denied if an undisclosed pre-existing condition is discovered—or if the insurance company finds that the cause of his illness is his own \"unreasonable or capricious behavior,\" a category that would include things like excessive partying, per Billboard. Though it was reported that West was placed on a 51-50 psychiatric hold and committed against his will, a source tells People that's not the case. \"He went freely\" and \"was not restrained,\" the source says. \"There was a small altercation at the gym but he was deemed medically stable and decided to seek medical help at his doctor’s request.\" The source also echoes previous reports that West is simply dealing with exhaustion and sleep deprivation. Wife Kim Kardashian is by his side at the hospital, a source tells E!. \"Their time together was just about support. Kanye will be OK. He has a good set of doctors.\""

    "document": "Our planet Earth flies between the sun and the outer planet Jupiter on May 8 (if you’re in the Americas or Pacific) or May 9 (for time zones in the rest of the world). That passage places Jupiter – largest world in our solar system, and a very bright planet in our sky – opposite the sun. In other words, Jupiter is now rising in the east as the sun is setting below the western horizon. Astronomers call this event an opposition of Jupiter. \n \n Opposition marks the middle of the best time of year to see a planet. That’s because it’s when the planet is up all night and generally closest for the year (the exact date of Jupiter at its closest this year is May 10). \n \n Your astronomical calendar for 2018 likely gives the date and time of Jupiter’s 2018 opposition as May 9 at 1 UTC. That translates to May 8 at 8 p.m. Central Daylight Time in North America (translate UTC to your time). \n \n Rising in the east around sunset, Jupiter climbs highest in the sky at midnight. It sets in the west around sunrise. Jupiter is always bright; it’s the largest planet in our solar system. It shines more brightly than any star in the evening sky. \n \n With the exception of the sun and moon, only Venus – the brightest planet, now in the west after sunset – outshines Jupiter. Try catching both Venus and Jupiter at nightfall now. Venus will be blazing low in the west and Jupiter, a bit fainter but still brighter than any star, will be shining in the east. Venus will set as Jupiter ascends in the eastern sky. \n \n At this 2018 opposition, Jupiter shines in front of the constellation Libra the Scales. The closest 2nd-magnitude star to Jupiter is Zubenelgenubi, Libra’s alpha star. Dazzling Jupiter – a planet in our own solar system and much closer to us than any star – outshines Zubenelgenubi by over 100 times. \n \n Jupiter comes to opposition about every 13 months. That’s how long Earth takes to travel once around the sun relative to Jupiter. As a result – according to our earthly calendars – Jupiter’s opposition comes about a month later each year. \n \n Last year – in 2017 – Jupiter’s opposition date was April 7. \n \n Next year – in 2019 – it’ll be June 10. \n \n Astronomer Guy Ottewell has a great post at his blog this week on Jupiter’s opposition and its location in our sky this year. The charts below (used with permission) are from Guy: \n \n There’s a NASA spacecraft orbiting Jupiter now. The Juno spacecraft’s orbit carries it low over Jupiter’s poles, providing never-before-seen glimpses of the giant planet’s polar regions. Jupiter isn’t a rocky planet like Earth. It’s more like a failed star, not massive enough or hot enough inside to spark thermonuclear fusion reactions, but some 2.5 times more massive than all the other planets in our solar system combined. Jupiter shows us nature magnified! Check out the video below, which provides an infrared view of the massive cyclones at Jupiter’s poles: \n \n Take an infrared tour of #Jupiter in a new 3-D flyover movie showing massive cyclones in the planet’s north pole.

You’d need some 80 Jupiters – rolled into a ball – to be hot enough inside for thermonuclear reactions … for Jupiter to shine as stars do. Yet on this May night – as Jupiter rises opposite the sun – you can imagine it beaming down on us as a tiny sun all night long. \n \n Read more: How to see Jupiter’s moons \n \n Donate: Your support means the world to us ||||| Story highlights Indonesia had the best view of the total solar eclipse \n \n The next total eclipse is on August 21, 2017 but will only be visible from parts of the U.S. \n \n Share your best photos and videos of the eclipse by tagging #CNNSpace on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. \n \n Jakarta (CNN) Crowds across Asia were treated to stunning views of a total solar eclipse on Wednesday morning. \n \n Those in Indonesia had the best vantage point. The moon blacked out the sun in totality over Indonesia's main western island of Sumatra, before moving eastwards across Sulawesi and Borneo, and then over to the Maluku Islands. \n \n The eclipse was also partially visible in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Hawaii and northern Australia, NASA said. \n \n JUST WATCHED What is a solar eclipse?

Earth is just about to pass directly between Jupiter and the sun, making this the brightest that the gas giant will glow in the night sky for the entire year. \n \n Starting at 6 AM on March 8, Jupiter will directly oppose the sun, appearing to rise as the sun sets. So as long as skies are clear, the planet will show off its sparkling face after nightfall and will continue to be easily spotted from dusk till dawn for several days. At its peak, the giant planet will appear brighter than any other stars and the second-brightest planet after Venus. \n \n Jupiter will also be at its closest tonight, meaning even those without telescopes can get a great view, Geoff Gaherty writes for Space.com. To find it, just look for Leo. Right now, Jupiter lingers in the southern regions of the constellation, shining nearly 30 times brighter than the nearby star Regulus, Deborah Byrd writes for EarthSky.org. \n \n If Jupiter alone isn't enough of a treat, its moons should provide plenty of entertainment. Upwards of 60 different moons orbit the gas giant, but are usually too tiny to spot with the naked eye. The four largest moons (Io, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa) are visible alongside Jupiter even with just a set of binoculars. First observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610, the four moons, which are known as the “Galilean Moons,” are some of the solar system’s most intriguing objects. \n \n According to NASA, Io is the most volcanically active object in our solar system, and is shrouded in thick clouds of multicolored sulfur. Europa, on the other hand, is cloaked by a thick sheet of ice, which astronomers believe may cover a massive ocean of liquid water or slushy ice—a potential spot for lurking life. \n \n Callisto has the oldest landscape in the solar system and is riddled with craters that can provide astronomers with a physical record of our planetary system's earliest days. Meanwhile Io is the largest moon in our solar system and is the only one that generates its own magnetic field. \n \n With a small telescope aimed at the sky, eagle-eyed viewers can watch as the four moons zip through their orbits around the giant planet. On the night of March 14, almost week after Jupiter enters opposition, stargazers will get a chance to see Europa and Io transit in between Jupiter and the Earth, with Europa beginning its journey at 9:27 P.M. EST, and Io following shortly after at 10:12 P.M, according to Astronomy Magazine. \n \n Although Jupiter enters opposition once a year, the exact timing varies because of differences between Earth’s orbit and the gas giant’s. It takes about 13 months for the Earth to get back in position between Jupiter and the sun, which means that each year opposition occurs a month later than the year before. \n \n So cross your fingers for a clear night and point your eyes to the skies to catch Jupiter shining bright. ||||| Jupiter reaches opposition with the sun on March 8, at 6 a.m. EST. Since it is directly opposite the sun in the sky, it rises just as the sun sets, remains visible all night long, and sets as the sun rises. \n \n Jupiter is now the brightest object in the night sky with the exception of the moon and the International Space Station. There's no difficulty telling the difference between Jupiter and the space station, because Jupiter appears stationary, while the orbiting laboratory moves across the sky rapidly, taking about 5 minutes to cross. \n \n The largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter is more than 11 times the diameter of Earth, and is more than 300 times as massive. Although it has a solid core, Jupiter is mostly made of hydrogen and helium gas. Near the planet's core, the hydrogen exists in a metallic form (meaning it conducts electricity). The planet's rapid rotation (less than 10 hours) causes its atmosphere to be drawn out into the darker belts and brighter zones seen on its surface. [Don't Miss These 12 Must-See Skywatching Events of 2016] \n \n Jupiter is currently located in the southern part of the constellation Leo, the lion. The planet is about a third of the way between the bright stars Regulus in Leo and Spica in Virgo. Seeing Jupiter in Leo brings back memories of my first night as a serious stargazer, when in 1957 I saw Jupiter for the first time, and identified the stars and constellations around it. \n \n Leo makes a very distinctive pattern in the stars, and has two parts: a sickle or reversed question mark on the right and a right triangle on the left (as seen from the Northern Hemisphere). Regulus marks the dot on the bottom of the question mark, and Denebola the far angle of the triangle. Leo contains one of the finest double stars in the sky, Algieba, which is just above Regulus, and several bright galaxies, especially Messier 65 and 66, just under the right angle of the triangle. \n \n Just to the right of Leo is the dim constellation Cancer, which is mainly notable for containing one of the nearest and brightest open clusters of stars, Praesepe, or the Beehive, No. 44 in Charles Messier's catalog of deep-sky objects. This cluster, 590 light-years distant, is actually brighter than any of the individual stars in the constellation. \n \n To Leo's left is the huge constellation Virgo, which contains many more galaxies than it does stars. Its brightest star, Spica, represents a sheaf of wheat in the hand of the virgin, a harbinger of spring. \n \n Above Virgo is the constellation Boötes, which contains Arcturus, the third brightest star in the sky, outshone only by Sirius and Canopus. Boötes is supposed to be a herdsman, but always looks more like a kite to me. \n \n If you own binoculars, try mounting them solidly and see if you can see Jupiter's four brightest moons. These were one of the first major discoveries made by Galileo in 1609 with his newly constructed telescope. He realized within a few days that these tiny spots of light were in orbit around the planet, and he used this to help prove Copernicus' model of a sun-centered system of planets. \n \n Jupiter's moons are fascinating to watch in even the smallest telescopes. They can be seen shifting positions in less than an hour, and often pass in front of or behind Jupiter itself. When passing in front of Jupiter, they cast their shadows on the giant planet's face. \n \n The cloud tops of Jupiter's thick atmosphere are clearly visible in amateur telescopes. Two dark cloud belts parallel its equator, with thinner cloud belts visible toward its poles. It has a famous cyclonic feature in its upper atmosphere with a distinctive salmon-pink color, known as the Great Red Spot. This has been followed by astronomers for several centuries, making it the oldest and largest storm system in the solar system, about three times the size of the Earth.",
    "summary": "– People in other parts of the world are being treated to a solar eclipse this week, but Americans get a consolation prize with a terrific view of Jupiter in the night sky. Earth is passing between the sun and Jupiter, making the planet as bright as it will be for the entire year, reports Smithsonian. In fact, only the moon and the International Space Station will be brighter, notes Space.com. You'll find Jupiter in the constellation Leo, and the website has a diagram and more specifics of where to look. The best part is you can catch a glimpse of Jupiter at pretty much any time, adds a post at EarthSky.org: \"You can see it in the east at nightfall and early evening [starting Tuesday]. Around midnight, when the sun is below your feet, Jupiter appears high overhead. At dawn tomorrow, you’ll see Jupiter low in your western sky.\" The planet will be easily visible for several days. As for that solar eclipse, if you don't happen to live in Indonesia, CNN notes that you can watch it via a NASA livestream here, beginning at 8pm Eastern Tuesday."

    "document": "About 80% of them are from Honduras. Many said they are fleeing poverty, but also political unrest and violence that followed the swearing in of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández after a highly contested election last year. The group often breaks into chants of “out with JOH.” They also chant “we aren't immigrants, we're international workers” and “the people united will never be defeated.” \n \n The number of people who showed up to travel with the caravan caught organizers by surprise, and has overwhelmed the various towns they've stopped in to spend the night. Pueblos Sin Fronteras counted about 1,200 people on the first day. \n \n When they get to the US, they hope American authorities will grant them asylum or, for some, be absent when they attempt to cross the border illegally. More likely is that it will set up an enormous challenge to the Trump administration's immigration policies and its ability to deal with an organized group of migrants numbering in the hundreds. \n \n “If we all protect each other we'll get through this together,” Abeja yelled through a loudspeaker on the morning they left Tapachula, on Mexico's border with Guatemala, for the nearly monthlong trek. \n \n Organizers like Rodrigo Abeja hope that the sheer size of the crowd will give immigration authorities and criminals pause before trying to stop them. \n \n Organized by a group of volunteers called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders, the caravan is intended to help migrants safely reach the United States, bypassing not only authorities who would seek to deport them, but gangs and cartels who are known to assault vulnerable migrants. \n \n For five days now hundreds of Central Americans — children, women, and men, most of them from Honduras — have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them. \n \n When the agent, who'd covered her uniform with an orange and white shawl, learned that the Central American migrants heading her way numbered more than 1,000, she took off for the restaurant across the street. \n \n Taking a drag from her cigarette, a Mexican immigration agent looked out toward a caravan of migrants that grew larger with each step they took on the two-lane highway. \n \n Migrants hitchhike along the side of the highway as they move toward the city of Mapastepec, Chiapas. \n \n Sweating after miles of walking in more than 90-degree heat with her two kids, Karen said conditions in Honduras were so bad she decided to take a chance with the caravan. She declined to give her full name. \n \n \n \n “The crime rate is horrible, you can't live there,” Karen told BuzzFeed News on the side of a highway near Huixtla, a town in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state. “After the president [was sworn in] it got worse. There were deaths, mobs, robbed homes, adults and kids were beaten up.” \n \n Before setting out on the journey, the migrants were organized into groups of 10 to 15 people, and a leader was designated for each group. Five groups were then banded together in what organizers call a sector. While there are organizers from Pueblos Sin Fronteras leading the way, much of the effort to get to the US border is in the hands of the migrants themselves. \n \n They've been organized into security, food, and logistics committees. Organizers say it's meant to help the migrants empower themselves. \n \n Sandra Perez, 40, who's also from Honduras, is one of two women who belong to the security committee. It's not her first caravan: She has traveled with a procession of Central American mothers through Mexico in search of disappeared migrants. \n \n “I like doing this, it makes me happy and I feel useful,” she told BuzzFeed News. \n \n Not everyone is planning on crossing into the United States undetected. Migrants like Yonis, an Honduran man who declined to use his full name, are hoping to get their families to other parts of Mexico. He was able to legalize his status in Mexico and is hoping to get his wife and seven month old baby to the Mexican state Nuevo León. \n \n \"I have my life there,\" Yonis told BuzzFeed News. \"We're all here fighting together, going to different borders, chasing an American dream that sometimes becomes a reality or doesn't for some.\" \n \n Organizers estimate that about two-thirds of people are planing on crossing into the United States undetected or asking for some type of protection like asylum. \n \n Twenty-nine-year-old Mateo Juan said the caravan was his third attempt at getting to the United States. Seven months ago, Mexican immigration officers pulled him off the bus. The same happened about a month ago. \n \n He heard about the caravan in March when he arrived in Tapachula, the caravan's starting point. \n \n “Going alone is risky. You're risking an accident, getting jumped by robbers, and even your life,” he told BuzzFeed News. “All of that, and then you don't get to the United States. The caravan is slower but you know you're going to get there safely.” \n \n Still, there are no guarantees on the route or assurances that once they reach the US border they'll be able to cross undetected or be allowed to stay under some type of protection like asylum. \n \n Alex Mensing, another organizer with Pueblos Sin Fronteras, made that point clear to the migrants before the group started out. He also stressed that everyone is responsible for their own food, water, and payment for vans or buses. Still, it's far cheaper than being assaulted or falling into the hands of unscrupulous smugglers. \n \n “I'm here to work together with the people who had to leave their countries for whatever reason,” Mensing said through a loudspeaker. “We're fighting together. We're not here to give anyone papers and we're not here to give anyone food.” \n \n Mensing said Pueblos Sin Fronteras isn't calling on people to make the trek, but if they're going to try to go through Mexico on the way to the United States, the group will help them. \n \n The caravan propels itself forward using whatever way it can. Sometimes that means packing into the back of a truck, negotiating lower rates for vans, or hitching a ride on the back of empty big rigs from whatever town they're in. The group sleeps in town plazas. Local townspeople and churches feed them. \n \n In the evening, when the group settles in for the night, the kids play in playgrounds or dart among the crowd, chasing one another. Teenagers and adults play soccer using rocks as goal posts. \n \n On Tuesday, the caravan had plans to board the freight train known as “the Beast” or sometimes “the Train of Death” in Arriaga to speed the journey north. It's a dangerous part of the journey, with death and injury only too possible from a precarious perch atop a rail car, and the group practiced boarding, one woman in a purple shirt slowly making her way up a parked train's ladder while the crowd below cheered her on. On another train car, men wearing backpacks steadily made their way up one by one. ||||| Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “Caravans” of people enter their country.

I knew that if Gatorade could do the right thing, so could Powerade. \n \n A couple months ago, I found out that one of my favorite drinks, Gatorade’s Orange, contained brominated vegetable oil (BVO). According to Scientific American and other news reports, BVO is patented as a flame retardant and has been banned in Europe and Japan. So I started a Change.org petition asking Gatorade to stop using it. More than 200,000 people signed my petition on Change.org and we won! But I learned that BVO is also in other drinks, like Powerade’s red fruit punch that is actually sold in my school! \n \n It’s weird because Gatorade’s fruit punch doesn’t have BVO! But Powerade’s fruit punch does, and it is probably one of the most popular flavors for my friends. It is so wrong to be selling something like that to a bunch of kids anywhere!

Why do these companies put all this weird, crazy stuff in our food and drinks? \n \n After Gatorade agreed to remove BVO from their drinks, a lot of people have been encouraging me to keep going, so now we’re back to officially ask Powerade to do the same thing! It’s common sense that sports drinks here shouldn’t contain crazy ingredients that are banned in entire countries because of health concerns. \n \n I’ve read some crazy information about how BVO and the ingredient bromine can build up in people’s bodies over time and how the chemical is linked to problems with hormones and fertility and stuff like that. I also saw that Powerade may be the official drink of the NCAA for college athletes! Athletes shouldn’t be drinking that! NASCAR also has a deal with Powerade, but I don’t know why unless it’s to put out those engine fires! \n \n Gatorade did an amazing thing and agreed to stop using BVO, and I hope the entire beverage industry is paying attention. Consumers don’t want BVO and every day that they keep it in there makes us trust them less. \n \n For now though, Powerade pretends to be a healthy sports drink and it has to decide if it wants to be the only one (there will be no BVO in Gatorade or Vitamin Water) that still uses a chemical banned in Europe and Japan and that its main competitor, Gatorade, agreed to remove. \n \n I know Powerade will listen.

I also love sports like volleyball, and I always believed Gatorade when they said stuff in their ads about how it's good to drink when exercising. And, just like most people, I care about my health. So, as I was sitting at home the other day drinking an Orange Gatorade, I decided to look up some of the ingredients. \n \n The last ingredient is \"brominated vegetable oil,\" which has been banned in Japan and the European Union. That means, #1 it’s not necessary to make Gatorade, and #2 there is enough information out there that entire countries have banned this chemical product. \n \n According to Scientific American, BVO has been patented as a flame retardant and is found in some beverages including some flavors of Gatorade. It is “under intense scrutiny because research has shown that they are building up in people's bodies, including breast milk, around the world.” The same article also mentions that there are “links to impaired neurological development, reduced fertility, early onset of puberty and altered thyroid hormones.” \n \n I’m not a scientist, but if there are lots of suspicious things about putting a flame retardant chemical in Gatorade (most flavors don’t even use it!) then why would Gatorade want to put it in a product designed for people like me who are into sports and health? \n \n It doesn’t make sense. Please sign my petition asking Gatorade to stop putting flame retardant chemicals in sports drinks. \n \n Photo by marcgelinas on Flickr ||||| FILE - In this Aug. 5, 2010 file photo, bottles of Powerade sports drink and other Coca-Cola products are chilled over ice in Orlando, Fla.

A controversial ingredient, brominated vegetable oil, is being... (Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) — Coca-Cola is dropping a controversial ingredient from its Powerade sports drink, after a similar move by PepsiCo's Gatorade last year. \n \n The ingredient, brominated vegetable oil, had been the target of a petition by a Mississippi teenager, who questioned why it was being used in a drink marketed toward health-conscious athletes. The petition on Change.org noted that the ingredient is linked to a flame retardant and is not approved for use in Japan or the European Union. \n \n In response to customer feedback, PepsiCo said last year it would drop the ingredient from Gatorade. At the time, Coca-Cola declined to say whether it would remove the ingredient from the two flavors of Powerade that contain it as well. \n \n But this week, bottles of Powerade in fruit punch and strawberry lemonade flavors being sold in the Detroit, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska, New York and Washington, D.C. areas no longer list the ingredient. Some bottles still list it, however, suggesting Coca-Cola Co. may have started phasing it out recently. \n \n A representative for the Atlanta-based company confirmed Sunday that its Powerade brands are \"BVO-free.\" But no details were immediately available on when the change would be complete or how the drinks were reformulated. \n \n Powerade's website still lists brominated vegetable oil as an ingredient for its fruit punch and strawberry lemonade flavors. \n \n The Food and Drug Administration says brominated vegetable oil is used as a stabilizer for flavoring oils in fruit-flavored drinks. Coca-Cola has said in the past that it uses it to \"improve stability and prevent certain ingredients from separating.\" \n \n The decision by Coca-Cola to remove brominated vegetable oil from Powerade is just the latest evidence that food makers are coming under pressure for the ingredients they use. While companies stand by the safety of their products, some are making changes in response to the movement toward foods that people believe are natural. \n \n Earlier this year, for instance, Subway said it would remove an ingredient dubbed the \"yoga mat chemical\" from its breads. The ingredient, azodicarbonamide, is approved for use by the FDA and can be found in a wide variety of breads. The petitioner, Vani Hari of FoodBabe.com, said she targeted Subway because of its image for serving healthy food. \n \n Likewise, brominated vegetable oil can also be found in several other drinks. \n \n But the Mississippi teenager, Sarah Kavanagh, said she targeted Gatorade and Powerade in petitions because they're designed for athletes, who are likely more concerned about what they're putting into their bodies. Her Powerade petition had more than 59,000 online supporters while the Gatorade one had more than 200,000. \n \n As Americans cut back on soda, sports drinks have become more important for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc., which is based in Purchase, New York. \n \n Although Coca-Cola has long dominated rival PepsiCo on the soda front, it lags the company in the growing sports drink category. According to the industry tracker Beverage Digest, Gatorade has 64 percent of the sports drink market. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi",
    "summary": "– Looks like a teenager's online petition has induced Coca-Cola to remove an ingredient from Powerade. The Mississippi teen, Sarah Kavanagh, led the charge with two Change.org petitions against brominated vegetable oil—one targeting Powerade, the other Gatorade—that gathered nearly 260,000 supporters in all, the AP reports. PepsiCo agreed to pull BVO from Gatorade last year, and now Powerade bottles in strawberry lemonade and fruit punch flavors in several cities don't have the ingredient listed. Some bottles still list it, and Coca-Cola said today that Powerade is \"BVO-free,\" so it seems the company is phasing it out. Just what is BVO? According to the FDA, it's used in fruit-flavored drinks as a stabilizer for flavoring oils. But Bromine is a patented flame retardant that's banned in the European Union and Japan, and may be harmful to anyone who drinks it in large amounts, the Telegram reports. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo aren't the only companies under pressure from petitions: Subway yanked an FDA-approved ingredient known as the \"yoga mat chemical\" from its breads earlier this year when a petitioner at FoodBabe.com challenged the company's healthy-food image."

    "document": "NASA has suspended certain activities with Russia. But the space station is exempt, and the rift highlights that, for the next few years, the US can't send astronauts into space without Russia. \n \n Is the English language becoming less significant in Europe after Brexit? \n \n Why migrants, en route to the United States, are pausing in Mexico \n \n Why the new health-care bill may keep affordable care out of reach for some \n \n A spacecraft carrying a NASA astronaut and two Russian astronauts docks on March 27 at the International Space Station later than scheduled after dealing with a technical issue mid-flight. \n \n The International Space Station, long a symbol of international cooperation in space even among former adversaries, could become the next pressure point as the US tries to raise the stakes for Moscow after Russia's takeover and annexation of Crimea. \n \n On Wednesday, Michael O'Brien, NASA's associate administrator for international and interagency relations issued a memo to the agency's staff suspending bilateral contacts with Russia unless a specific activity has been given an exemption. \n \n \"This suspension includes NASA travel to Russia and visits by Russian Government representatives to NASA facilities, bilateral meetings, email, and teleconferences or videoconferences.\" wrote Mr. O'Brien. A copy of the memo was posted on the website SpaceRef.com. \n \n Bilateral contacts related to the operation of the space station are exempt, as are meetings held outside of Russia that involved additional countries – such as those that might be include the participation of the station's other main partners, Canada, Europe, and Japan. \n \n NASA's move is something of a diplomatic Post-it note; the two countries' space programs aren't engaged in many bilateral activities. Indeed, should operation of the space station come directly into play, the US and the other partners have the most to lose. \n \n They have the heaviest investment in the $150 billion orbiting outpost, and they cannot get into space without Russia, which has served as America's taxi service for delivering and retrieving US crew members from the space station, as well as delivering cargo to the station. \n \n So far, the Ukraine crisis has not interrupted US-Russia cooperation on the space station. But with the issuance of NASA's memo Wednesday, the question everyone is waiting to see answered is how Russian President Vladimir Putin responds. \n \n \"Is he going to be a rational international leader, or is he going to going to go the way of the egomaniac autocrat?\" asks Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor at the US Naval War College in Newport, R.I., and a specialist on space-security and space-policy issues. \n \n The motive behind including the Russians in the space station in first place stemmed partly from the country's experience with its own space station, Mir. But it also stemmed from a desire after the fall of the Soviet Union to keep Russian rocket scientists from finding work in countries whose intentions toward the US were anything but honorable. \n \n NASA's move comes as no surprise, says Dr. Johnson-Freese. \n \n Congress has banned NASA from working with China because of concerns about technology transfers and human rights. If NASA were to continue to work with Russia, that would say, \"It's OK to take over someone else's sovereign territory,\" she says. \n \n \"If the United States wants to avoid looking extremely hypocritical, this was going to be coming,\" she says. \n \n One US astronaut and two cosmonauts arrived at the station March 27 after a two-day trip aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule. On April 9, Russia is slated to launch a Progress resupply craft to the station. \n \n Even so, Wednesday's memo is expected to intensify the debate in Congress over restoring NASA's ability to launch astronauts from US soil. With the end of the US space shuttle program in 2010, Russia became the only country in the partnership able to transport crew members. \n \n \"We've always known that dependence carries risks,\" Johnson-Freese says. But the risk \"has been exponentially magnified\" by recent events. \n \n NASA has contracted with commercial providers such as Space Exploration Technologies, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Boeing to develop launch systems that can carry humans. The agency will eventually select one for actual transportation contracts. \n \n But some lawmakers have been lukewarm about the commercial approach, and the agency has been directed to continue developing a multipurpose launch system for low-Earth orbit and deep-space exploration. \n \n The first flight for \"commercial crew\" initially was envisioned for 2015, but funding hasn't kept pace. Now the first flights aren't anticipated until 2017. Meanwhile, each seat on a Soyuz runs about $71 million, up from $51 million when the US first began buying seats after the shuttle program ended, according to an analysis by the National Space Society, which supports commercial development of space. \n \n The Obama administration's fiscal 2015 budget request seeks $848 million to keep the commercial-crew program on track for 2017. And advocates would like to see Congress restore $171 million withheld from the program during the current fiscal year. ||||| MOSCOW, April 3 (RIA Novosti) - Washington's decision to freeze cooperation between the NASA space agency and its Russian counterpart on a slew of joint projects will hurt global space partnership but won't be the end of the Russian space program, Director of the Space Policy Institute Ivan Moiseyev told RIA Novosti Thursday. \n \n NASA issued a statement saying it put most of its joint missions with Russia on hold indefinitely. The only exception is the \"operational International Space Station activities,\" the agency's associate administrator Michael O'Brien said in a memo. \n \n \"The statement was way too harsh,\" Ivan Moiseyev told RIA Novosti. He warned NASA that its move would have a \"rather significant\" impact on space exploration projects globally. \n \n \"Modern space science is a global phenomenon that benefits all countries,\" Moiseyev noted. \"It means that many large-scale projects require an international effort. A freeze on cooperation will spur a serious backlash against the international space program.\" \n \n The space pundit added that, despite being something that Russia would never want for space science, this freeze was unlikely to have any catastrophic repercussions for its industry. Russia will simply have to adjust its projects to the new reality, he explained. \n \n Russia's senior space official said earlier in an interview with RIA Novosti that Russia didn't depend much on the United States, as far as space industry goes. \n \n This comes as the United States, European Union and their allies continue to ratchet up diplomatic pressure on Russia following its re-unification with the Russian-majority Crimea peninsula, which was taken over by Ukraine after the Soviet fall. \n \n Measures include sanctions against Russian and Crimean officials and businesses, who had their foreign assets seized. \n \n In a recent development, NATO member states suspended cooperation with Moscow allegedly until Russia changed its stand on the Ukrainian crisis, prompting the Russian Foreign Office to accuse the allies of trying to manhandle the country into accepting their viewpoint. ||||| NASA Statement regarding suspension of some NASA activities with Russian Government representatives \n \n Press Release From: NASA HQ \n \n Posted: Wednesday, April 2, 2014 \n \n Given Russia's ongoing violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, NASA is suspending the majority of its ongoing engagements with the Russian Federation.

If the Senate approves fast-track or trade promotion authority (TPA), it would then be sent to Obama’s desk to become law. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Fast-track authority would allow Obama to send trade deals to Congress for up-or-down votes.

Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) voted against the procedural motion. \n \n The Democrats cast \"yes\" votes even though the trade package did not include a workers assistance program for people displaced by increased trade. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program was a part of the last fast-track package approved by the Senate in May, but became a key part of opposition to the package among Democrats in the House. \n \n To move fast-track forward, the White House and GOP leaders in both chambers decided to break TAA away from fast-track and to try to approve both in separate votes. \n \n After the Senate votes Wednesday on final passage for fast-track, it will take a procedural vote on a package that includes TAA and trade preferences for African countries known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). \n \n McConnell has promised both bills will reach Obama’s desk by the end of the week. \n \n “If we all keep working together and trusting each other, then by the end of the week the President will have TPA, TAA and AGOA and Preferences on his desk,” he said on the floor. \n \n The House has already passed fast-track but it must still vote on the package including TAA, which faces opposition from conservatives. \n \n Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) reiterated on Tuesday his pledge to vote again on TAA as soon as it clears the upper chamber. \n \n “The House will consider TAA once it passes the Senate as part of a new trade preferences bill. And we are ready to go to conference on the customs bill. Our goal is to get TPA and TAA to the president's desk this week and deliver this win for the American people,” he said in a statement. \n \n The Senate vote to end a filibuster against fast-track appeared in doubt until the final moment as a group of pro-trade Democrats balked at McConnell’s decision to split it off from TAA, a move made necessary to circumvent opposition in the House. \n \n Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Chris Coons (Del.), Ben Cardin (Md.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Maria Cantwell (Wash.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Patty Murray (Wash.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) refused to say publicly how they would vote. \n \n McConnell’s margin for error shrank further when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is running for president, announced he would vote to block the bill, declaring in a Breitbart.com op-ed that it had “become enmeshed in corrupt Washington backroom dealmaking.” \n \n Other Republican White House hopefuls, including Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, oppose fast-track. \n \n Sen.

This is our chance to put in place higher standards in global trade on matters like labor rights and environmental protection, shine some real sunlight on trade agreements and ensure that our country writes the rules of the road,” he said. \n \n Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who co-wrote the trade bill with Wyden, argued the vast majority of global economic growth will take place outside of the United States over the next decade. \n \n “If our workers, farmers, ranchers and service providers are going to be able to compete in these growing markets, we must have open access to these markets and fair trade rules to boot,” he said on the floor. \n \n Opponents led by Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) warned fast-track would cost thousands of American jobs and allow multi-national companies to evade U.S. law. \n \n Brown reproached his colleagues for voting to give Obama fast-track authority while having little idea of the shape of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade accord that will receive expedited consideration in Congress as a result. \n \n “We’ve gotten the worst of both worlds because we’re voting on TPA and we haven’t been able to see what’s in TPP,” Brown said before the vote. \n \n The AFL-CIO waged a fierce lobbying campaign against fast-track for months. \n \n “It will do nothing to prevent repeating the mistakes of failed trade policies that have contributed to stagnating wages, increasing inequality and the closure of more than 60,000 factories since 2000,” the union wrote in a letter dated Monday. \n \n Thomas J. Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and other business leaders applauded the development. \n \n “Today’s vote is an important step towards revitalizing our economy, creating more good American jobs, and reasserting our country’s global economic leadership,” Donohue said in a statement. \n \n Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) missed the vote. McConnell said Corker would have voted \"yes\" if he had been present, while Brown noted that Lee and Menendez would have voted \"no.\" ||||| Getty Senate salvages Obama trade agenda More than a dozen Democrats side with the GOP to give the president fast-track authority. \n \n With no votes to spare, the Senate salvaged President Barack Obama’s trade agenda on Tuesday, putting a measure to give him enhanced powers to strike free trade deals on track to be signed into law by the end of the week. \n \n But the lead-up to the decisive vote exposed serious friction between the two parties over the chamber’s next big problem: the imminent shutdown of a government financial institution that conservatives despise, the Export-Import Bank. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The trade bill advanced 60-37, with the minimum votes needed to break a Democratic-led filibuster against the so-called Trade Promotion Authority. Thirteen Democrats sided with GOP leaders on the vote, and five Republicans, including presidential contenders Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the legislation. \n \n But discord between pro-trade Democrats and GOP leaders was on vivid display on the Senate floor leading up to the vote. Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) could be seen having an animated talk with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) as the Republican pressed for her support and she sought a vote to renew the Export-Import Bank charter, which lapses next week. Heitkamp mentioned “Ex-Im” several times as she weighed whether to become one of the decisive votes for the president’s push for new trade deals with European and Pacific Rim countries. \n \n “John, I will tell you this,” Heitkamp told Cornyn, referring to the bank. “It’ll pass. It’ll pass overwhelmingly.” \n \n But GOP leaders didn’t offer any assurances to prevent the bank’s charter from expiring at the end of the month. Ex-Im provides credit and loan guarantees to American exporters. Cornyn said that he and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) remain committed to a vote on Ex-Im in July, after the bank’s authority has already lapsed. \n \n “I think our chances of not having the Ex-Im charter expire are gone,” Heitkamp said. “This is typical of the United States Congress to not only not do things timely, but completely late and disrupt the lives of thousands of American workers and thousands of American businesses. It is a sad day that we’re gonna walk out of here without renewing the Ex-Im charter.” \n \n Heitkamp was among several Democrats who wavered on the trade vote until the final moment. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) withheld his vote before finally voting no. When Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) swept into the chamber to deliver the 60th vote to break the filibuster, Republican leaders were elated to see him. Had he not shown, Republican leaders were prepared to hold the vote open to allow GOP Sen. Bob Corker to fly back from Tennessee to finish the job. \n \n As the Nevadan strolled into the Senate chamber shortly after 11:30 a.m., Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) smiled at Heller and yelled: “Mr. 60!” \n \n Democrats ultimately decided to trust McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to follow through on a joint pledge to shepherd into law both TPA — which gives Obama “fast-track” trade authority — and a measure to help laid-off workers known as Trade Adjustment Assistance. TPA will allow Obama to complete the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, but Democrats have long insisted that it be accompanied by TAA, which provides aid and job training for workers who lose their jobs to trade. \n \n Despite the opposition of most of the party, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) did not lean on his caucus to reject the trade bill as he had at one point in May. \n \n “I still hate the whole program,” Reid said after the vote. “I’ve never voted for a trade bill; I never even considered voting for this one. I’m not happy with it.” \n \n Boehner and McConnell issued a flurry of promises that they will usher TAA through their respective chambers; a vote in the Senate is expected on Thursday. For many Democrats, that was enough. \n \n “I have been assured that the House and the Senate will take up TAA and the enforcement legislation,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who was concerned as late as Monday that the workers aid bill would not pass. “I appreciate the speaker saying he’s going to take it up this week and Sen. McConnell filing cloture on it.” \n \n Still, the reluctance to move forward was evident even among those who had announced on Monday that they would vote to advance TPA. \n \n “What made me feel comfortable? I don’t think comfort has anything to do with it,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). “It’s the right thing for my state.” \n \n The Senate passed a TPA/TAA package in May. McConnell and Boehner unlinked the two bills after the package could not pass the House, while promising to pass each separately in order to assuage Democrats who’ve insisted on the worker aid. \n \n “This place has become pretty polarized over the years, and there’s not been a lot of trust,” Cornyn told reporters. “We needed to reassure our Democrat colleagues … that takes a little bit of trust. But I think it will reap benefits far beyond just this particular piece of legislation.” \n \n Getting to 60 votes, though, took more than just trust and public promises. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who helped write the trade legislation with Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), spent Monday evening working the phones to keep as many pro-trade Democrats as he could on board. With the newly announced opposition of Cruz, leaders could lose only two pro-trade Democrats. \n \n Wyden said he spoke with House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Monday to press GOP leaders to include the wishes of pro-trade Democrats in Senate and House-passed Customs enforcement legislation when the House and Senate iron out their differences. Meanwhile on the floor, McConnell buttonholed Cardin, who appeared to be waiting until the 60th vote was cast to register his opposition but held out until Heller arrived. \n \n Immediately before the vote, Cardin said he’d received “a lot of interest” from the White House and trade critics who had wooed him in recent days. He said his biggest concern was over the sequencing of the bills — he wanted the worker aid package and other outstanding trade bills all tied together with the fast-track proposal. \n \n “For reasons I don’t understand, they are bringing up TPA first,” Cardin said. “And that’s created a great deal of heartache for me.” \n \n Indeed, Cardin’s position demonstrated how difficult the vote was for many Democrats, who found themselves under intense pressure from unions and progressives. Senate Democrats supportive of the fast-track trade legislation huddled Monday night for a strategy session, but most remained mum about how they would vote. \n \n With the legislation hanging in the balance, anti-trade labor and liberal groups stepped up their last-minute whipping efforts, with AFL-CIO Director of Government Affairs William Samuel writing senators to vote “no” or risk “leaving U.S. workers in the lurch.” And Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), one of the most vocal opponents of the fast-track bill, railed against TPA moments before the vote, accusing Congress of turning its back on a “moral” obligation to assist the working class. \n \n “How shameful,” Brown said. “We’re making this decision knowing that people will lose their jobs because of our action.” \n \n But Republicans also had to deal with Cruz’s last-minute denunciation of TPA, even though he supported it last month with TAA attached. In an op-ed for Breitbart News, Cruz accused GOP leaders of cutting a deal with Democrats to keep Ex-Im alive. \n \n “No comment,” Hatch said when asked about Cruz’s flip. “I’ve learned a long time ago, when people run for president, you really can expect some very bizarre things.” \n \n Manu Raju contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON — President Obama’s ambitious trade push is back on track, after several near-death moments, in large measure because top Republicans stood by him. \n \n The Senate on Tuesday narrowly voted to end debate on legislation granting Mr. Obama enhanced negotiating powers to complete a major Pacific trade accord, virtually assuring final passage Wednesday of Mr. Obama’s top legislative priority in his final years in office. \n \n The procedural vote of 60 to 37 just reached the minimum needed, but final Senate passage will require only 51 votes. The House approved trade promotion authority last week. \n \n With congressional support for “fast track” authority, the president can press for final agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a legacy-defining accord linking 40 percent of the world’s economy — from Canada and Chile to Japan and Australia — in a web of rules governing Pacific commerce. His administration can also bear down on a second agreement with Europe — known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership — knowing that lawmakers will be able to vote for or against those agreements but will not be able to amend or filibuster them. \n \n Photo \n \n The Atlantic agreement is not expected to be completed until the next administration is in office, but the trade negotiating powers would stretch for six years — well into the next presidency. Together those two accords would put much of the globe under the same trade rules, not only lowering tariffs and other import barriers but also creating new standards for Internet access, intellectual property and investor protections. \n \n “This is a very important day for our country,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, whose procedural maneuvering was largely responsible for the outcome. “America is back in the trade business.” \n \n Most Democrats — along with labor unions, environmental groups and liberal activists — disagreed, saying that such trade agreements had resulted in lost manufacturing jobs and lower wages for American workers. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “It is a great day for the big money interests, not a great day for working families,” said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. \n \n But 13 Democrats sided with Republicans to end the debate and get to a final vote on trade promotion authority. \n \n Tuesday’s vote was the second time the Senate had blocked a filibuster of fast-track authority, but this time the bill was shorn of a separate measure to offer enhanced retraining and educational assistance to workers displaced by international trade accords. That measure also faces a crucial vote on Wednesday. \n \n Passage of a stand-alone trade promotion bill will put pressure on House Democrats, who just over a week ago brought down the worker aid provision, known as trade adjustment assistance, when it was linked to the fast-track legislation, in a strategic move they hoped would defeat the entire trade package. \n \n But Republican leaders — with support from the White House — found a parliamentary way to corner the Democratic opponents, by separating the two pieces of the bill. By Wednesday evening, legislation will most likely be on the president’s desk, giving him the power to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He can sign it whether or not the House passes worker dislocation assistance when it is scheduled to come to a vote late Thursday. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said House Democrats should get on board. \n \n “The previous explanation that we heard from some Democrats who voted against trade adjustment assistance — something that Democrats have steadfastly supported for decades — is that they were doing that in an effort to slow down the advancement of trade promotion authority legislation,” he said. “That will no longer be a factor to consider.” \n \n The tortuous path of the trade legislation over the last six months created the unusual alliance between Mr. Obama and Republican leaders, who otherwise have worked to thwart him on domestic and foreign policies. \n \n “Occasionally, even the leader of the Democratic Party, the president of the United States, gets things right,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. \n \n In the end, Mr. McConnell all but secured the top remaining legislative priority of a president he once vowed to turn out after one term. \n \n The Senate is set on Wednesday to give final approval to trade promotion authority, then vote to end debate on a separate bill that attaches worker dislocation assistance to a broadly popular bill extending a trade agreement with several African countries. \n \n To attract more votes, Senate leaders added another provision speeding up action against foreign competitors who are found to be “dumping” — selling steel and other products in the United States at artificially low prices in an effort to put domestic manufacturers out of business. \n \n Senators would vote on that package on Thursday, and if it is approved, as expected, it would go to the House the same day. \n \n This time, if Democrats vote down trade adjustment assistance, they will be effectively killing a worker education and retraining program created during the Kennedy administration and that party members have nurtured ever since, but will still most likely watch Mr. Obama sign the fast-track bill into law. \n \n “I don’t think any Democrats voted against T.A.A. last time because they opposed T.A.A.,” said Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House’s No. 2 Democrat. “I will concede there will be a different context” around the next vote. \n \n At the same time, House and Senate negotiators will begin hashing out differences over a separate bill enhancing measures to police trade agreements. \n \n Opponents had hoped that trade promotion authority without worker assistance would run into trouble in the Senate. And some Democrats tried to stoke fears that Congress could give the president the power to complete major trade deals without assistance to affected workers. \n \n “How shameful is that?” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who led the opposition to trade promotion authority. “We’re making this decision knowing people will lose their jobs because of our actions. Yet we are not going to pass this assistance.” \n \n In the end, though, Democratic senators who had already voted once for trade promotion authority understood they were not going to escape the criticism, especially from the unions. They wanted to be done with it. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “Senate Democrats had already taken a lot of hits in getting to this point,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee and a co-author of the trade promotion bill. \n \n Only one senator, Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, changed his vote from last month. In April, Mr. Cruz wrote an article with Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, extolling the trade promotion bill for giving Congress more power over future trade accords. \n \n Under the trade promotion bill, such accords could not be considered by Congress for four months after completion, and for two of those months, the agreements would have to be made accessible to the public. The bill adds dozens of negotiating objectives requested by lawmakers, who still could vote down any deal struck. \n \n Since then, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of Mr. Cruz’s rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, announced his opposition to the trade promotion bill, and some conservatives voiced opposition to any bill enhancing Mr. Obama’s authority. \n \n On Tuesday, on the conservative website Breitbart.com, Mr. Cruz denounced the bill he once supported.",
    "summary": "– President Obama's trade agenda lives to fight another day. The Senate this morning handed him the 60 votes he needed, voting 60-37 to end debate on his request for fast-track negotiating authority. It'll vote on final passage for fast-track tomorrow, which the New York Times sees as \"virtually ensured\" as final passage needs just 51 votes. As earlier reported, 14 Democratic senators backed fast track in a late May vote, and 13 did so today. The timeline, per the Hill: After the fast-track vote, the Senate will vote on a package that includes Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA)—a measure that would provide job training and other help to people who lose their jobs because of the trade deal. Democrats have insisted TAA be paired with the fast track; some on the other side of the aisle oppose it. The House will then need to vote on it, and both Mitch McConnell and John Boehner have pledged to make TAA law. As Politico puts it, today's vote \"came as Democrats wavered on whether to trust\" them to do so."

    "document": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – A Trader Joe’s store assistant manager was killed by gunfire from Los Angeles police officers during a chase and shootout with a suspect in Silver Lake Saturday. \n \n LAPD Chief Michel Moore told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that investigators have determined that one of two officers accidentally shot 27-year-old Melyda Corado while engaging in a shootout with the suspect, 28-year-old Gene Evin Atkins. \n \n “I’m sorry to report that we’ve now determined through our forensic investigation, that one of the officers’ rounds struck Ms. Corado as she was exiting the market and was in close proximity to Atkins,” Moore said. “Ms. Corado ran back into the store and collapsed behind the manager’s desk.” \n \n According to Moore, Atkins’ car had slammed into a light pole outside the entrance of the Trader Joe’s, located in the 2700 block of Hyperion Avenue. \n \n Upon hearing the crash, Corado was one of several people who ran to the front door of the store, at the same time that an armed Akins himself ran towards the entrance. \n \n “As he did so, witness statements and physical evidence from the scene support that Atkins fired multiple rounds from a semiautomatic pistol at the officers,” Moore said. “The two Los Angeles police officers who had been pursuing Atkins returned fire in defense of their lives and to protect Atkins from harming other individuals.” \n \n The officers fired eight rounds in returning Atkins’ gunshots, Moore said. \n \n The fatal bullet first hit Corado’s arm, then entered her body. \n \n Atkins appeared in court Tuesday to face more than 30 charges, including one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder, 13 counts of false imprisonment of hostages and one count of felony evading. His arraignment was postponed to Aug. 14. His bail was set at $18.7 million. \n \n The slaying is attributed to Atkins even though he did not fire the fatal bullet because he is held to have caused the entire situation. \n \n Moore also released dash-cam video leading up to the chase. Watch it below. \n \n Before Saturday’s shootout at Trader Joe’s, Atkins allegedly shot and wounded his grandmother, who remains hospitalized, and 17-year-old girlfriend. He then led police on a chase, ending at the store. \n \n The Trader Joe’s store remained closed Monday, while a memorial of signs and flowers in memory of Corado continued to grow outside the building. \n \n Although Atkins was booked on suspicion of murder, he could potentially face charges including attempted murder for the roughly 1:30 p.m. Saturday shooting of his 76-year-old grandmother — Mary Elizabeth Madison — in the home they shared in the 1600 block of East 32nd Street. Authorities said the woman was shot as many as seven times and remains hospitalized in critical condition. \n \n Atkins’ cousin, Charleo Egland, said she didn’t know exactly what prompted the shooting, but said the grandmother did not want Atkins’ girlfriend in the home, and that likely led to a fight that ended with the shooting. \n \n Police said Atkins’ girlfriend was also wounded in the shooting, and Atkins forced her into his grandmother’s car then drove away with her in the passenger seat. \n \n Using a LoJack system, police traced the 2015 Toyota Camry sedan to the Hollywood area and gave chase, leading to Silver Lake, where Atkins crashed the Toyota into a power pole around 3:30 p.m. in front of the Trader Joe’s supermarket, Moore said. \n \n Atkins got out of the car and ran into the store, firing toward officers as he ran, police said. \n \n A short time later, a woman now known to be Corado was seen being dragged away from the store’s entryway and then unsuccessfully treated by paramedics trying to revive her. \n \n Moore said about 40 people were in the store when Atkins entered. As Atkins ran inside, employees and customers inside scrambled for cover. \n \n Some were seen escaping through a window toward the rear of the business and crawling down a ladder to safety. \n \n Police were also seen carrying several children away from the building. \n \n Atkins’ girlfriend, who had been in the passenger seat of the Toyota when it crashed in front of the store, was taken to a hospital in fair condition. Fire officials described her as a 20-year-old woman. \n \n Police amassed outside the store, and around 5:30 p.m., at least three people who appeared to be customers came out of the store with their hands in the air — apparently hostages who were released or shoppers who had managed to elude the gunman. \n \n Atkins surrendered at about 6:30 p.m. He was taken to a hospital to be treated for a gunshot wound to his left arm. \n \n Margaret Stewart of the Los Angeles Fire Department said paramedics treated 10 people at the scene of the Trader Joe’s, including Atkins, his girlfriend and Corado. A 12-year-old boy, a 41-year-old woman, a 70-year- old woman and an 81-year-old woman were hospitalized with minor injuries and listed in fair condition, Stewart said. Three other people were evaluated, but declined to be taken to hospitals. \n \n Moore returned to the crime scene Tuesday to be among the mourners. \n \n “This is about, frankly, an opportunity to pay some respects to a family and to a loss,” Moore said, appearing to become emotional at times. “This young lady, by every description, had so much to live for, and to a father that has lost, I’m sure it’s (indescribable).” \n \n Reaction to the revelation that officers had accidentally killed Corado was mixed. \n \n “I kind of blame the police because they were shooting directly towards the store,” nearby business owner Peter Hakopyan said. \n \n Hakopyan told CBS2 he knew Corado and witnessed the shootout. \n \n “It’s a grocery, and there’s people around,” Hakopyan added. “I would think the police would have more restraint.” \n \n Still, some appreciated the precarious situation in which the officers found themselves. \n \n “The police did what they felt they had to do in the moment. They couldn’t know,” said longtime Silver Lake resident Miranda Birch. “I think it’s tragic, but I think it’s a mistake to blame the police.” \n \n A GoFundMe page set up to help cover Corado’s funeral expenses had raised nearly $25,000 as of midday Monday. \n \n (©2018 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

    "document": "An anesthesiologist was sentenced to 10 years in prison Tuesday for what a judge called \"reprehensible\" sexual assaults on 21 sedated women during surgeries – violations that left his victims with lasting emotional damage. \n \n Dr. George Doodnaught, 65, exploited the extraordinarily high degree of trust the patients placed in him, Ontario Superior Court Justice David McCombs said. \n \n \"The profound psychological impact of the physical violations has been compounded by the victims' deep feelings of betrayal – that these offences were committed during surgery, by a medical doctor, in an operating room, a place of ultimate vulnerability and trust,\" McCombs said in sentencing Doodnaught. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \"His conduct did enormous damage and was reprehensible in the extreme.\" \n \n Many of Doodnaught's victims were in the courtroom and wiped tears from their eyes as the sentence was read. Their victim impact statements at an earlier sentencing hearing told of \"debilitating\" feelings of anger and bitterness, shame, panic attacks, loss of self-worth, distrust of doctors and an inability to form intimate relationships, McCombs said. \n \n \"In several cases [Doodnaught] compounded his victims' sense of violation and humiliation by manipulating them to try to make them believe they were somehow responsible – that they had initiated sexual contact or had engaged in sexually explicit conversations,\" the judge said. \n \n Though Doodnaught was sentenced to 10 years, he may not spend much time in custody. Doodnaught intends to appeal his convictions, and the Court of Appeal for Ontario is set to hear an application Wednesday to let him out on bail pending the appeal. \n \n He was on bail throughout the trial, so his victims stayed in the courtroom after the sentence was read to see the handcuffs slapped on and the disgraced doctor led out of the room. \n \n One of his victims – the one who sparked the investigation – clapped as he was led away. Outside court, she said the prospect of more court hearings as Doodnaught proceeds with his appeal is \"devastating,\" but she will keep attending and fighting to be heard. \n \n \"At this point, I've come this far and I need to show my children how to do the right thing and how to stand up [against] what's wrong and this is so wrong on so many levels and I need to do that for them,\" she said with her husband by her side. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n The woman, who can't be identified because of a publication ban, had a mass on several organs when she went in for a hysterectomy in 2010. During the surgery, Doodnaught fondled her breasts, kissed her and put his penis in her mouth, the court found. \n \n When she was in the recovery room, Doodnaught leaned in close to her and said, \"As soon as you were out, the first thing you reached for was my … [penis],\" the court found. \n \n Doodnaught declined the opportunity to make a statement before he was sentenced, which the victim said was telling. \n \n \"Never once during this whole process, even when I was on the stand, when I was giving my victim impact statement, at any time, did he look at me,\" she said outside court. \"He's a coward.\" \n \n Doodnaught's lawyer, Brian Greenspan, said his client was \"disappointed\" with the sentence. \"He continues to enjoy widespread support not only with his family but amongst his colleagues, patients,\" he said outside court. \n \n The judge noted that the defence filed 49 letters of support from Doodnaught's family, former colleagues, patients and friends. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \"They are uniformly shocked that the man they know has been found to have committed these crimes,\" McCombs said. \n \n \"His family members and supporters describe him as a modest, caring and loving person and a supportive and generous mentor, who took great pride in his work as an anesthesiologist and most of all, in his family.\" \n \n When Doodnaught was convicted in November, McCombs found the doctor relied on his three decades of operating-room experience to avoid detection as he kissed women, fondled their breasts and put his penis in their mouth or hand. \n \n Doodnaught was known as a \"touchy-feely\" doctor, often stroking a patient's cheek or hair to soothe them during surgery, so the judge found his physical proximity during surgery didn't arouse suspicion with other staff even as he sexually assaulted the women while concealed only by a surgical drape. \n \n It is a unique set of circumstances in Canadian law, McCombs said Tuesday. \n \n \"There are no reported Canadian cases in which an anesthesiologist sexually assaulted sedated patients in an operating room during surgery,\" he said. \n \n All but one of the assaults took place at the North York General Hospital in Toronto. They became more frequent until Doodnaught was caught, with the first six spread over three and a half years and 15 others in the last six months before he was stopped. \n \n The hospital told Doodnaught to take a leave of absence after the last woman he assaulted went to police. \n \n His medical licence was suspended, but the College of Physicians and Surgeons still has to hold a disciplinary hearing, which could lead to it being revoked. \n \n The hospital's chief executive officer has apologized on behalf of the medical facility to all of the victims for the impact Doodnaught's crimes had on their lives. The hospital has since made changes to how it addresses and tracks patient complaints. ||||| Former North York General anesthesiologist Dr George Doodnaught was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years imprisonment for sexually assaulting 21 of his female patients. As Doodnaught, 65, was handcuffed and arrested from court, a few of the women clapped. \n \n George Doodnaught is shown in a Toronto police handout photo. The anesthesiologist convicted of sexually assaulting 21 sedated women during surgeries has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. ( Photo / Canadian Press ) \n \n His conduct was “reprehensible in the extreme,” Superior Court Justice David McCombs said in his decision. “It must be condemned in the strongest terms.” In November, Doodnaught was found guilty of sexually assaulting 21 women between the ages of 25 and 75 while they were semi-conscious on the operating table. All but one of the women were undergoing surgeries at North York General Hospital between 2006 and 2010. Doodnaught was a popular anesthesiologist at the hospital for 26 years. \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n The Crown had asked for 12 to 15 years imprisonment during the sentencing hearing earlier this month. The defence suggested eight to 10 years. “I am very happy with the conviction, however I am very disappointed with the sentencing,” said the patient whose complaint launched the criminal investigation. She cannot be identified due to a publication ban. “Ten years, as far as I’m concerned, is insulting.” The judge made his decision based on the law, and the laws need to change, she said. During the trial, her testimony and the reading of her victim impact statement, she says, Doodnaught did not look at her once. “He’s a coward,” she said. \n \n In his lengthy judgment released in November following the 76-day trial, McCombs found that Doodnaught took advantage of his position in the operating room, concealed behind a sterile screen that separates patients’ upper and lower bodies. Hidden from the doctors and nurses, Doodnaught fondled the breasts of sedated female patients, kissed their mouths and forced them to perform oral sex and masturbation, McCombs found. \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n In his sentencing decision, McCombs noted that in the months before Doodnaught was arrested the assaults escalated. Fifteen of the 21 assaults occurred in the past six months, four in the 10 days before his arrest. Doodnaught’s lawyer, Brian Greenspan, said Doodnaught and his family are disappointed by the convictions. They are appealing the convictions but not the sentence. The notice of appeal filed with the court argues that McCombs erred in finding the testimony of the complainants plausible and “rejected evidence inconsistent with guilt.” That includes the defence submission that it was impossible for Doodnaught to have committed the assaults based on the proximity of operating room staff and the positioning of medical equipment. A bail hearing for Doodnaught’s release pending appeal is scheduled for Wednesday morning at the Court of Appeal. In his sentencing decision, McCombs noted the “great personal courage and dignity” of the victims and their families, and the “profound psychological impact” they suffered. Patients had made three formal sexual assault complaints to North York General Hospital about Doodnaught before a complaint in 2010 sparked a criminal investigation. The hospital’s chief of anesthesiology was aware of the complaints but the senior hospital administration only learned of them after the 2010 complaint was made, McCombs found in his ruling. Serious complaints about staff, including allegations of sexual assault, are now being reported directly to the hospital’s CEO. Doodnaught, whose medical licence is suspended, is set to face a disciplinary hearing with the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons. A date has not yet been set. In the notice of hearing, the College notes that the mandatory penalty for sexually abusing a patient is a revoked licence and public reprimand. While there were only 21 patients involved in the criminal case, the notice of hearing contains allegations that Doodnaught sexually abused 30 patients. One of the alleged sexual assaults dates back to 1992.",
    "summary": "– One of his victims clapped as George Doodnaught got led away in handcuffs, and it's hard to blame her: The Toronto anesthesiologist got sentenced to 10 years in prison today for sexually assaulting her and 20 other women during surgery. The victims were \"sedated but still aware of their surroundings\" during the assaults, reports AFP. The 65-year-old fondled them and forced oral sex on them, among other things. In the recovery room, he would tell the women that they had initiated once the drugs kicked in. “Never once during this whole process, even when I was on the stand, when I was giving my victim impact statement, at any time, did he look at me,” the woman who clapped tells the Globe and Mail. “He’s a coward.” Doodnaught worked at North York General for 26 years, and all but one of the victims had surgery there between 2006 and 2010, reports the Toronto Star. He was often separated from the rest of the medical team with a surgical drape. Though not part of the criminal case, allegations of about 10 other assaults date back to 1992."

He also admitted to concocting the tale of its invention, which has become a part of Louisville lore. \n \n “I was nobody,” said Seger, who recently helped open The Tuck Room in downtown Manhattan to the Times. “I had no previous accolades in the bar world.

He decided to include the recipe on the menu as an homage to the history of the hotel, which inspired Fitzgerald's novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\" \n \n \"The explanation he gives for its creation is this, that a bartender at the old Rathskeller bar opened a bottle of champagne, whose contents shot into the air.

He recently admitted his fabrication to Gaz Regan. \n \n “To be honest, I always suspected that Adam had created the drink, but I really, really loved it, his story was almost plausible, and I needed recipes for ‘New Classic Cocktails,' \" he said, according to the Times. \n \n While the hotel, now known as the Seelbach Hilton, is aware of the Seger's transgression, a hotel official said that it has no plans to remove the drink from its menu. \n \n The cocktail \"has certainly been a tradition of the hotel and will remain part of its future,\" said Matthew Willinger, the hotel’s director of public relations, according to the Times. \n \n The Seelbach Cocktail (Photo: File Photo) \n \n The Seelbach Cocktail (Makes 1 drink) \n \n 1 ounce Old Forester bourbon \n \n 1/2 ounce triple sec \n \n 7 dashes Angostura bitters \n \n 7 dashes Peychaud bitters \n \n 5 ounces chilled Korbel Brut \n \n 1 orange twist, for garnish \n \n Combine the bourbon, triple sec and both bitters in a champagne flute; stir briefly, just to blend.

But as the New York Times reports, the \"rescued classic\" that gained fast notoriety and established Seger as a brand name was in fact Seger's own creation, a \"ruse\" as the Louisville Courier-Journal calls it.

    "document": "“The Grey” continues what has become a welcome seasonal movie tradition. For the past three winters, just when the Oscar nominees you’ve missed are trying to dazzle and guilt-trip you with visions of Importance, a lean and angry Liam Neeson shows up at the multiplex, out for righteous payback or at least the paycheck that no one would dare begrudge him. Buy a ticket, punk! Having paid his quality biopic dues as Oskar Schindler, Michael Collins and Alfred Kinsey, Mr. Neeson has, at least for now, turned to the rougher and perhaps more lucrative work of action heroism. It takes nothing away from his earlier achievements to note that he’s really good at it. He conveys a ferocious and absolute seriousness even when the going gets silly, and he finds the soul in each new angry-everyman cipher he is asked to play. \n \n In “Taken” and “Unknown,” he explored the genre in its fast-moving, super-twisty cosmopolitan thriller mode. Those were glib entertainments improved by their star’s natural gravity. “The Grey,” directed by Joe Carnahan from a script he wrote with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (based on Mr. Jeffers’s story “Ghost Walker”), is something else entirely: a stripped-down, elemental tale of survival in brutal circumstances, as blunt and effective — and also, at times, as lyrical — as a tale by Jack London or Ernest Hemingway. It’s a fine, tough little movie, technically assured and brutally efficient, with a simple story that ventures into some profound existential territory without making a big fuss about it. \n \n The geographical territory the film stakes out is a bleak, frozen and harshly beautiful corner of Alaska, where Mr. Neeson and a bunch of other excellent actors are stranded after surviving a plane crash. Mr. Neeson’s character, Ottway, is part of a tribe of brawlers, drinkers and lost souls who work in the Arctic oil fields. His job is to roam the tundra with a high-powered rifle, “a salaried killer for a petroleum company,” picking off the predatory animals that menace the other workers. Ottway doesn’t say much, and we know nothing of his background other than that he once had a wife (played in flashbacks by Anne Openshaw). His melancholy voice-over narration early on is a letter to her. \n \n The sentiments he expresses there hint at a core of tenderness behind his gruff, hangdog demeanor. It is clear that he is a man of violence with a keen, ruthless survival instinct, but also that he harbors deep reservoirs of sorrow and compassion. Shortly after the crash, tending to a badly injured passenger who clearly won’t make it, he eases the man’s passing with breathtaking gentleness. \n \n That is not a phrase you would ordinarily associate with Mr. Carnahan, whose directing résumé includes exquisite delicacies like “Smokin’ Aces” and “The A-Team.” The sadistic, macho bluster of those movies seemed, at best, a gesture of mock rebellion, something to make football fans and beer drinkers feel like warriors. Such extreme, noisy fantasies of embattled pseudo-manhood might work as parody if they showed any genuine wit. \n \n But “The Grey” unfolds in a mood of grim earnestness and is grounded in an idea of masculinity under duress that is no less authentic for being thoroughly sentimental. The survivors are all guys, every one possessing his own special blend of insecurity, bravado, courage and stupidity. They are bundled up in parkas, their faces obscured by stubble, snow and blood, so their personalities emerge through action and interaction. \n \n Some live, some die, and rather than divulge their fates, I’ll list the names of the hardy souls who trudge off into the woods with Ottway: Burke (Nonso Anozie), Henrick (Dallas Roberts), Talget (Dermot Mulroney) and Diaz (Frank Grillo). One is a cynical ex-con, another a God-fearing father, but Mr. Carnahan doesn’t overplay their differences or push the actors — all excellent — toward caricature. He respects their individuality and the specific life-or-death predicament each must face. \n \n Pursued by wolves, the men start to replicate the pack behavior of their predators. At one point, just out of sight, they hear howls and yelps that Ottway explains are the sounds of the alpha putting down a challenge to its authority. A few minutes later he does the same thing, dealing with someone foolish enough to question his wisdom and instincts. \n \n Not that Ottway is in control of the situation. It is hard, in this cozy, wired-up, GPS world, to imagine circumstances in which human beings would be so completely at the mercy of nature, but Mr. Carnahan constructs a persuasive picture of primal danger. The wolves (designed by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger) are an unremittingly, unromantically hostile presence, in part because the world into which Ottway and the others have tumbled belongs so completely to them. Their imperative is to hunt, eat and finally destroy the intruders, and every other natural force, from gravity to the weather to blind chance, seems to be on their side. \n \n Which means that much of “The Grey” is devoted to the practical details of problem-solving: building fires, improvising weapons, securing food, keeping watch. Such details are the building blocks of suspense and also the scaffolding for the big themes that hover in the wintry air. \n \n Action movies, including Mr. Carnahan’s earlier films, often turn death into sport, numbing pain, fear and desolation with the visceral rush of violence. “The Grey,” meticulous in its choreography of fight and flight, and questionable in its depiction of wolf behavior, is notable for the thoughtfulness and sensitivity with which it addresses the thorny ethical and metaphysical matters of mortality. It takes death seriously, and partly as a consequence, every moment, every frame, feels alive. \n \n “The Grey” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Nature red in tooth and claw; men cursing a blue streak. \n \n The Grey \n \n Opens on Friday nationwide. \n \n Directed by Joe Carnahan; written by Mr. Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, based on Mr. Jeffers’s short story “Ghost Walker”; director of photography, Masanobu Takayanagi; edited by Roger Barton and Jason Hellman; music by Marc Streitenfeld; production design by John Willett; produced by Jules Daly, Mr. Carnahan, Ridley Scott and Mickey Liddell; released by Open Road Films. Running time: 1 hour 57 minutes. \n \n WITH: Liam Neeson (Ottway), Frank Grillo (Diaz), Dermot Mulroney (Talget), Dallas Roberts (Henrick), Joe Anderson (Flannery), Nonso Anozie (Burke), Ben Bray (Hernandez), James Badge Dale (Lewenden) and Anne Openshaw (Ottway’s wife). ||||| Kimberley French Liam Neeson goes from being the hunted to being the hunter in ‘The Grey.' \n \n Those rabid eyes, that snarling face barely concealing a glimpse of tooth as he stalks with a coiled intensity. Anything can happen if he springs. \n \n A wild wolf? No — Liam Neeson, a guy even wolves should be scared of in the gripping thriller “The Grey.” With a bellyful of lite Hemingway – most of the film’s do-or-die decisions are followed by serene acceptance of rugged death – and a heavy soul that never drags it down, director Joe Carnahan’s great adventure follows Neeson’s lead and stays steely to the end, even as its grizzled winners take nothing. \n \n Neeson’s sharpshooter, John Ottway, works for an Alaskan refinery, shooting animals that threaten the oil rig workers. En route to a job, a rickety plane carrying Ottway and what he calls a standard crew (criminals, ex-cons, “the a—holes of the world”) crashes in the wilderness. The handful of wounded men must quickly figure out how to survive. \n \n Each hour that gets harder. Building fires and finding food is tough enough. Fighting off packs of white wolves is the real threat, as well as snowstorms, a miles-high gorge and fights that could tear them apart before they can cross a river into the trees, and get closer, they hope, to civilization. \n \n Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers’ screenplay, based on Jeffers’ novel, has some of the same man-vs.-nature elements as “Flight of the Phoenix,” “The Edge,” “Alive,” “The Way Back” and Jon Krakauer’s book “Into Thin Air.” It is, in the best sense, like a men’s adventure magazine splashed on the big screen. \n \n In addition to a sturdy crew of supporting actors, including good turns from Dermot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts and Frank Grillo, there are also haunting snippets of Ottway’s lost love, memories of an emotionally distant father and shouted challenges to any almighty force. (“Fine, I’ll do it myself,” Ottway mutters when no miracles arrive to save him.) The gristle inside this movie is one of the things that save it from being simply a series of challenges. \n \n Neeson is perfect for this stuff. There have been high points among his “paycheck roles” over the last few years, yet it’s seemed, to an outsider, like he may have been escaping into big-budget work as a way of coping with his own personal tragedy, the death of wife Natasha Richardson in 2009. \n \n We’ll never know, of course, but if that is the case, here’s hoping that “The Grey,” with its dark themes and gut-level grappling of courage and loss, helps bring him back where he belongs. ||||| The title \"8 Million Ways to Die\" was already taken, so \"The Grey\" had to settle for \"The Grey,\" named for the plus-size wolves waging war on the desperate human survivors of an Alaskan wilderness plane crash. Tough situation. Frostbite. Wolf bite. Drowning. Falling from great heights. Harsh outcomes abound for both man and beast. \n \n And yet the film takes some time to let its characters ruminate, by way of dialogue, on their circumstances, which gives \"The Grey\" a distinctly late-20th-century feel. The film stars Liam Neeson, a bona fide 59-year-old action hero, as an oil refinery sharpshooter charged with keeping predators at bay. Working from a short story by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, who wrote the script's first draft, co-writer and director Joe Carnahan places the formidable Neeson in the middle of a scary and bracing picture with more on its mind than advertised. Some of \"The Grey\" is phony, and it was a mistake to make the rogue wolves large enough to be mistaken for critters out of \"Twilight.\" But Carnahan is smart enough to keep full-view images of the antagonists in check. And there's an actual human element to go with Carnahan's Jack London-inspired depiction of humans against the elements. \n \n We meet Neeson's character, a heartbroken loner named John Ottway, on the verge of suicide and thinking back, obsessively, to the woman who got away. His demons temporarily quelled, Ottway boards a small plane with his fellow refinery workers and in one of the most nerve-racking flights ever put on film, the aircraft runs afoul of bad weather and crashes. (For a turbulence wimp like me, this scene was not easy.) \n \n Eight survive, at first. Ottway, the alpha male, knows what he's doing. So does the alpha male of the wolf pack on their trail. The rest of the humans are played by an interesting ensemble of nonstars including Dermot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts, Nonso Anozie, Frank Grillo and others. The film shrewdly does not tip its hand about who's living and who's dying. \n \n Carnahan indulges himself in ways most filmmakers would avoid: He gives several of the men, for example, extended soul-searching discussions about God's existence (or not), about owning up to one's fears, about the precarious nature of love. The best parts of \"The Grey\" connect the interior lives of these roughnecks with their newfound and lethal obstacles to safety. Carnahan made \"Smokin' Aces\" (which I hated) and\"The A-Team\"(which wasn't bad, actually); wisely, he shot and edited \"The Grey\" like neither of those pictures. This one's more relaxed in its rhythms, a brooding drama about a brooding man in a terrible situation. Only occasionally are there computer-generated ravines that must be leapt across; thankfully much of the action was shot in northern British Columbia, and a lot of the wind and snow and scenery is real. My favorite shot of Carnahan's is a close-up on Mulroney's face as he waits in line, behind Neeson, for a tricky ravine crossing. Most directors wouldn't care much about the supporting actor; they'd be too worried about fluffing up the lead's heroics. \n \n Neeson holds it together from first to last. He is the rumbly voiced king of the late-January/early February action film, per \"Taken\" and\"Unknown,\"and by now moviegoers have been subliminally conditioned to pay money to hear that warm hearth of a speaking voice, under duress but coolly so, this time of year. Call \"The Grey\" \"Deliverance\" Lite, with snow, and wolves. And call it a solid January surprise. \n \n mjphillips@tribune.com \n \n 'The Grey' -- 3 stars \n \n MPAA rating: R (for violence/disturbing content including bloody images, and for pervasive language) \n \n Running time: 1:57 \n \n Opens: Friday ||||| The computer-generated wolves have more personality than any of the dull characters in The Grey. \n \n What starts as a tense and moody survival thriller fairly quickly becomes tedious, forced and far-fetched as a septet of men is preyed upon by a wolf pack in the Alaska wilderness. \n \n Wolves are much maligned in literature and films. The Grey (* * stars out of four, R, opens Friday) takes the notion of their vicious natures to new extremes as dozens of hulking, bright-eyed beasts attack a ragtag assortment of plane-crash survivors with startling ferocity. When they're not ripping people to shreds — as seen up close and personal through an annoyingly shaky camera — they're lurking ominously nearby, howling and growling. \n \n Liam Neeson stars as Ottway, a melancholy loner working among oil-rig roughnecks. Apparently, it's his job to keep the work site safe from animal attacks. When he's not shooting the furry denizens, he's obsessing over a letter he wrote to a woman he loved and lost. He spends a good portion of the movie rereading that letter. He has recurring dreams about his beloved lying in gauzy sheets, and he often recites the lines of a trite poem and consistently reaffirms his lack of religious faith. \n \n Fresh moves are clearly not this guy's thing. \n \n Subtlety is not a trait preferred by writer-director Joe Carnahan (The A Team), either. Early on, Neeson's Ottway sticks a shotgun in his mouth. Why he doesn't pull the trigger is left unexplained. \n \n Next, he boards a small plane bound for Anchorage. Shortly after takeoff, turbulence rocks the plane and it crashes spectacularly in what looks like Arctic tundra. Bodies and plane parts are mangled and scattered across the icy landscape. Ottway takes charge, rounding up the half-dozen survivors and calming a dying man. \n \n This all seems out of character for a guy who a few scenes earlier had seemingly lost the will to live. But he's still no match for the menacing wolves. \n \n Suspense devolves into a rote tale of man vs. beast. The survivors don't fully capture our sympathies because no one is given much dimension. Verbal nastiness erupts occasionally between the humans, but most of their time is spent trudging through snowdrifts and getting into bloody tussles with wolves. \n \n In a climactic scene, the wolf pack inexplicably stands patiently, waiting for Ottway to get ready, arm himself and take a few moments to recite a snippet of a hackneyed poem before they attack. It's as if they were instructed on the gentlemanly art of battle. \n \n In every other scene, the wolves come off as more brutal than bears, sharks and anacondas combined. With its reliance on jolts, sudden movements and thunderous sounds, The Grey is more startling than frightening.",

    "document": "by Maria Owings, Ph.D.; Sayeedha Uddin, M.D., M.P.H.; and Sonja Williams, M.P.H., Division of Health Care Statistics \n \n PDF Version (153 KB) \n \n This report provides estimates of male newborn circumcisions performed during the birth hospitalization. Using data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), annual rates of newborn circumcision are presented for 1979–2010. National and regional rates are shown in both tabular and graphical form, and trends across the 32-year period are discussed. Note that these estimates do not include circumcisions performed outside the hospital setting (e.g., ritual circumcisions) or those performed at any age following discharge from the birth hospitalization. Thus, these rates cannot be used as prevalence estimates for all male circumcisions in the United States. \n \n National trends \n \n Across the 32-year period from 1979 through 2010, the national rate of newborn circumcision declined 10% overall, from 64.5% to 58.3% (Table and Figure 1). During this time, the overall percentage of newborns circumcised during their birth hospitalization was highest in 1981 at 64.9%, and lowest in 2007 at 55.4%. \n \n However, rates fluctuated during this period, generally declining during the 1980s, rising in the 1990s, and declining again in the early years of the 21st century. These changes occurred during a period of changing guidance on routine newborn circumcision. For example, American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP) task force reports during the 1970s (1,2) stated there was no medical indication for routine circumcision of the newborn; AAP revised its position in 1989 (3), stating there were potential medical benefits to newborn circumcision; and then in 1999 (4), an AAP policy statement said that, despite potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision, there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine circumcision of newborns. \n \n Regional trends \n \n Newborn circumcision rates for the four U.S. census regions showed distinctly different patterns (Table and Figure 2). For newborns in the Northeast, the overall trend was flat across the 32 years, and no discernible patterns were evident, although annual rates varied between 60.7% (in 2007) and 69.6% (in 1994). In the Midwest, fluctuations in newborn circumcision rates generally mirrored trends in the national rate: declining until the mid-1980s, increasing until 1998, and then declining again through 2010. Rates ranged between 82.9% in 1998 and 68.8% in 2009. In the South, rates of newborn circumcision generally increased from 1979 until 1998, after which they declined. These rates ranged between 53.8% (in 1988) and 66.1% (in 1995). In marked contrast was the trend for the West. Over the 32-year period, the percentage of newborns receiving circumcision at birth decreased 37%, from 63.9% in 1979 to 40.2% in 2010. Most of this decrease occurred in the 1980s, with the rate dropping to 41.0% in 1989. Rates continued to decrease through 2010, with a low of 31.4% in 2003. \n \n Data sources and methods \n \n This report is based on data from NHDS, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) from 1965 through 2010. Data on newborn circumcision performed during the birth hospitalization have been collected in NHDS since 1979, when the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD–9–CM) (5) was instituted. NHDS is the only source of reliable, national, historical data on male newborn circumcision performed during the birth hospitalization. \n \n Circumcision rates for male neonates, based on NHDS data for 1999–2008, were reported and compared with those based on other data sources (i.e., the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Charge Data Master from SDI Health, Plymouth Meeting, PA) (6). Observed decreases in the incidence of the procedure differed among the data sources, but the maximum absolute difference for any given year was less than 6%. \n \n NHDS employed a stratified, clustered, multistage sampling design that produces unbiased national and regional estimates of hospital utilization in the United States. Data were collected from a sample of discharges selected from a national probability sample of nonfederal, short-stay hospitals. This analysis focused only on male newborn infants born during the sampled hospitalization. Circumcision was identified by the presence of ICD–9–CM procedure code 64.0 on the discharge record. \n \n Newborn circumcision rates over the 1979–2010 period were analyzed using JoinPoint (7), a statistical software program that detects discontinuities in trend lines and tests whether apparent changes in the slope of the trend line are statistically significant. Separate joinpoint models were fitted for the national newborn circumcision rate, as well as for each of the four census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). The best fit was determined by a series of permutation tests that attempt to fit the data to the smallest number of joinpoints. Statements made about differences, including those referring to increasing or decreasing trends, have been tested and found to be statistically significant. Statistical significance was determined based on an alpha level of 0.05. \n \n Additional NHDS publications on a range of topics are available from the NCHS website. Public-use electronic data sets are downloadable from the Web, and restricted-format data files are accessible only through the NCHS Research Data Center to authorized users. \n \n References \n \n Table \n \n Figures \n \n Figure 1.

Photo: Colourbox \n \n A poll showing 74 percent support for banning male circumcision comes as parliament prepares for a new round of political discussion on male circumcision. \n \n Nearly three fourths of Danes are in favour of banning male circumcision, a new poll revealed. \n \n In a survey of over 1,000 Danes conducted by YouGov for Metroxpress newspaper, 74 percent of respondents wanted a full or partial ban on the practice while just ten percent supported giving parents the right to circumcise their sons. \n \n The poll results come as parliament prepares to hold a hearing on the practice of circumcision on Wednesday. Left-wing party the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) and libertarian party Liberal Alliance are in favour of a ban, while other parties report internal disagreement on the issue. \n \n The debate about circumcision is a frequent topic in Denmark. Following extensive media coverage in both 2012 and 2013, the Danish Health and Medicines Authority (Sundhedsstyrelsen) carried out a study on the potential health risks and benefits of circumcision. In June 2013, the agency determined that there was neither enough risk to justify outlawing circumcision nor enough documentation of its benefits to generally recommend the practice. \n \n Despite the health authorities’ findings, Wednesday’s hearing in parliament may be the first step toward an eventual ban. \n \n “We will handle this topic politically within a few years. As I see it, it goes against the [UN’s] Convention on the Rights of the Child to circumcise children. I’m leaning toward a ban until the person is of legal age,” Venstre MP Hans Christian Schmidt, a former health minister, told Metroxpress. \n \n According to Sundhedsstyrelsen, somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 circumcisions are performed in Denmark each, primarily on Jewish and Muslim boys. Male circumcision is almost universal in the Muslim world and highly prevalent in many African countries. It is also a popular practice in the United States where more than half of all boys are circumcised and in Canada, where a 2007 survey put the percentage at 31.9 percent. \n \n Jair Melchior of the Jewish faith group Mosaisk Troessamfund cautioned politicians to not let opinion polls affect their stance on circumcision. \n \n “The problem is that there are so many assertions in the debate on circumcising boys. If it was so dangerous, the Jewish community would have been the first to stop it. But it’s not,” Melchior told Metroxpress.",
    "summary": "– \"To be circumcised should be an informed, personal choice,\" or so thinks the Danish Medical Association, which on Friday issued its recommendation that no boy under age 18 in the country be circumcised. Going that route then leaves the door open for the male to make a decision of his own \"when he has come of age,\" says Lise Moller, the head of the association’s ethics board. That's not to say the doctors' group is calling for a ban, which it says it weighed and decided against due to cases where male circumcision is medically necessary and for the potential for clandestine botched procedures, says Moller. Had they wanted a ban, they'd possibly face a steep slope. In a June report to the UN, Denmark agreed with Egypt's stance that it is a parental right to circumcise one's male child, reports the Copenhagen Post. Still, the Local reports that 74% of respondents to a 2014 survey said they'd support a full or partial ban. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 circumcisions take place in Denmark each year, and the country should have a firmer idea of that number as of Jan. 1, after which all circumcisions must be logged in Denmark's national patient registry, reports the Local. Doctors who fail to do so will be fined, reports the Post. The CDC reports that in 2010, an estimated 58% of male newborns were circumcised in the US. (This mom went into hiding and then to jail in an attempt to avoid circumcising her son.)"

Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. \n \n By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. \n \n 'The ability to accurately assess the intelligence of other persons finds its place in everyday social interaction and should have important evolutionary consequences,' the team wrote in the journal PLoS One. \n \n The team used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape. \n \n \n \n Both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs, they discovered. \n \n \n \n 'These results suggest that a perceiver can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men, but not women, by viewing their faces in photographs; however, this estimation is possibly not based on facial shape,' they claim. \n \n 'Our study revealed no relation between intelligence and either attractiveness or face shape. \n \n People can accurately judge intelligence by looking at faces of men, but not women.' \n \n Researchers found the same effect was not present when they used female faces \n \n They say this could be due to the fact attractiveness clouds the judgement. \n \n \n \n 'Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness,' they add. \n \n 'The strong halo effect of attractiveness may thus prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women.' \n \n \n \n The study, in the journal PLoS One, reports people tend to associate certain facial traits with high intelligence. \n \n \n \n The researchers report these notions 'represent nothing but a cultural stereotype,' but some still-unidentified visual cues apparently point them in the right direction. \n \n 'Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. \n \n \n \n 'By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. \n \n \n \n 'By contrast, we found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ test, either in men or women. \n \n \n \n Specifically, they write, 'two factors of general intelligence were significantly associated with perceived intelligence from men’s faces: fluid intelligence and figural intelligence. \n \n ' Fluid intelligence is the capacity to logically solve problems independent of acquired knowledge. \n \n Figurative intelligence describes the ability to handle objects such as images, patterns and shapes.” ||||| People can predict the IQ of men — but not women — by looking at their face, study finds \n \n New research published in PLoS One has found that a man’s facial characteristics contain some clues about his intelligence. Surprisingly, the same can’t be said for women’s facial traits. And the particular male facial characteristics linked with intelligence are a mystery. \n \n “Our raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher than chance from static facial photographs of men but not from photos of women. At the same time, we found no differences in the abilities of men and women to assess intelligence from static facial photos: the ratings of both sexes were highly correlated,” Karel Kleisner of Charles University in Prague and her colleagues wrote in their study. \n \n For their study, the researchers recruited 80 students, who completed an IQ test and had their face photographed with a neutral expression. Another 160 students rated the 80 photographs in random order for either perceived intelligence or attractiveness. \n \n The researchers found that people who were perceived as more attractive also tended to be perceived as more intelligent by both male and female participants. This link between perceived attractiveness and perceived intelligence was stronger for women’s faces than men’s faces. \n \n The researchers also found that the participants rated men with a high IQ as more intelligent based solely on their facial photograph. For women, however, the researchers found no statistically significant link between perceived intelligence and their actual IQ. \n \n Naturally, the findings raised the question of why people could predict men’s intelligence based on their face, but not predict women’s intelligence based on their face. The researchers proposed a number of explanations to be tested by future research. \n \n “One possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men’s faces, e.g. due to some genetic and developmental association to sex steroid hormonal agents during puberty,” Kleisner and her colleagues wrote. \n \n “Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness. The strong halo effect of attractiveness may thus prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women,” the researchers added. \n \n By examining the geometric features of the faces, the researchers were able to determine there was a link between certain facial characteristics and perceived intelligence for both men and women. \n \n “Our data suggest that a clear mental image how a smart face should look does exist for both men and women within the community of human raters,” the researchers explained. “In both sexes, a narrower face with a thinner chin and a larger prolonged nose characterizes the predicted stereotype of high-intelligence, while a rather oval and broader face with a massive chin and a smallish nose characterizes the prediction of low-intelligence.” \n \n But these facial characteristics were only associated with perceived intelligence. The researchers found no link between these facial traits and actual IQ scores. \n \n “This means that our raters accurately assessed intelligence from faces of men based on visual cues that simply are not explicable from shape variability in men’s faces,” the researchers wrote. \n \n But the correlation between these geometric traits and perceived attractiveness suggests there is an intelligence stereotype. \n \n “These faces of supposed high and low intelligence probably represent nothing more than a cultural stereotype because these morphological traits do not correlate with the real intelligence of the subjects,” the researchers said. ||||| Abstract Background The ability to accurately assess the intelligence of other persons finds its place in everyday social interaction and should have important evolutionary consequences. Methodology/Principal Findings We used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape. Both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs. In addition to general intelligence, figural and fluid intelligence showed a significant relationship with perceived intelligence, but again, only in men. No relationship between perceived intelligence and IQ was found for women. We used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are associated with the perception of intelligence, as well as with intelligence as measured by IQ testing. Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. By contrast, we found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ test, either in men or women. Conclusions These results suggest that a perceiver can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men, but not women, by viewing their faces in photographs; however, this estimation is possibly not based on facial shape. Our study revealed no relation between intelligence and either attractiveness or face shape. \n \n Citation: Kleisner K, Chvátalová V, Flegr J (2014) Perceived Intelligence Is Associated with Measured Intelligence in Men but Not Women.

Though numerous and varied mammalian species exhibit well developed facial structures, the communicative and expressive roles of the face reach a unique level of ability in human beings [1]. It is well established in previous research that faces inform us about personality, sex, age, health, ethnicity, social rank, attractiveness and political affiliation, as well as, to some extent, the intelligence of the bearer [2]–[9]. Some researchers have suggested that people tend to attribute higher intelligence to attractive persons [10], [11]. If women tend to prefer intelligent men because of their generally higher social status and these men in turn tend to prefer attractive women, the alleged covariance of attractiveness and intelligence should be of no surprise [12]. However, such findings are controversial and should be approached cautiously since Kanazawa's research methods and conclusions have attracted strong criticism [13]–[15]. As with physical attractiveness, intelligence is suggested to indicate good genes [16], [17]. This notion is supported by the fact that during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle, women display a higher preference for men who score highly in creative intelligence [18]. Intelligence is also correlated with humour, which is suggested to have evolved in sexual selection as an intelligence-indicator [19]. By modifying the good genes approach we find a bad genes hypothesis, which argues that even though unattractive faces signal poor genetic fitness, there is no difference in genetic fitness between faces of average and high attractiveness [20]. It has been also suggested that sexual selection has played a role in the evolution of particular facial features, which have evolved to signal high intelligence [10], [21]. Visual cues responsible for a higher attribution of intelligence may honestly reflect the real intelligence of a person and can therefore be used to indicate a preferential sexual or social partner. Past research shows that people are able to judge intelligence from the facial qualities of unknown persons, r = 0.28 [10]. Measured intelligence has been shown to correlate with perceived intelligence and other personality traits, whether self-reported (0.29) or rated either by intimate acquaintances (0.31) or strangers (0.38) [22]. In addition to visual cues, there is evidence of the accurate assessment of intelligence based on behavioural and acoustic cues [23]–[26]. For example, measured intelligence significantly correlates with ratings by stranger in sound-film conditions (0.38) but not in silent-film conditions [22] and the correlation between measured intelligence and ratings of fluent speech is as high as r = 0.53 [23]. In general, inferences of intelligence taken from thin slices of behaviour have been shown to be highly accurate [27]. Gender influences the accuracy of intelligence assessment. Men were more accurately assessed for intelligence than women, while women were more accurate at assessing the intelligence of both men and women [26], [28]. Although a number of studies have examined the perception of intelligence from different visual cues, none of these studies describe the specific facial traits that play a role in intelligence assessment. The specific aim of the present study is to determine which facial shape cues are responsible for the attribution of intelligence, as well as those which correlate with actual intelligence. We also sought to identify which particular factors of general intelligence can accurately be assessed from facial photographs. Finally, using thin-plate spline extrapolation, we provide a statistically supported description of the intelligence-stereotype in order to depict the facial traits responsible for an attribution of intelligence. \n \n Methods The present study integrates data from two different studies in which two independent groups of students participated: the first group consisted of 80 biology students at the Faculty of Science who were tested for IQ and photographed; the second group involved 160 raters, students at the Faculty of Humanities who rated the photos of the biology students either for intelligence or for attractiveness (each student rated 80 randomized photos). Dataset is available at http://web.natur.cuni.cz/flegr/IQKleisne​retal2013.xls Ethics statement The Institutional Review Board of Charles University, Faculty of Science approved this research. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants involved in our study. The data on measured intelligence, perceived intelligence and attractiveness were analyzed anonymously. IQ measurement To measure the intelligence of subjects, we used a Czech version of Intelligence Structure Test 2000 R [29], [30]. The test consists of a basic module, which is comprised of three verbal, three numerical, and three abstract figural reasoning tasks. The test also includes two memory tasks and a knowledge test. The knowledge test is focused on questions from geography/history, business, science, mathematics, arts, and daily life. As a whole, the test obtains a broad spectrum of results: the basic module measures verbal, numerical and figural IQ, as well as memory and reasoning; the knowledge test measures verbally, numerically and figurally coded knowledge; and both parts of the test measures fluid, crystallized, and general IQ. Fluid intelligence is the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations, independent of acquired knowledge. This sort of reasoning does not reflect cultural differences but arises from biologically given cognitive abilities. Crystallized intelligence is the ability to use skills, knowledge, and experience. This sort of reasoning improves with age and reflects the lifetime achievement of an individual [31]. Verbal intelligence is the ability to use language to analyze and solve problems associated with language-based reasoning. Numerical intelligence is the ability to manipulate numerical symbols and to comprehend quantitative relationships. Figural intelligence is the ability to combine shapes and forms and to analyze spatial patterns. The university students involved in this study showed a broad range of distribution of IQ (see Fig. 1.)

Histogram showing the range of distribution of IQ among university students involved in the present study. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081237.g001 We administered the exam on computers to 10–12 individuals in the same room and at the same time (at 9:15 am). The total length of time was about 145 minutes, including a15 minute break between the basic module and the second module with the memory tasks and knowledge test. The photographs Facial photographs of 80 students (40 men: Mean± SD = 21.8±2.8, range: 19–34, and 40 women: Mean± SD = 20.9±1.6, range: 19–24) from the Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, were used as stimuli. The subjects were seated in front of a white background and photographed with a digital camera, Canon 450D, using studio electronic flash and reflection screen. The subjects were instructed to adopt a neutral, non-smiling expression and avoid facial cosmetics, jewellery, and other decorations. The photos were cropped to place the eyes horizontally at the same height and leave a standard length of neck visible. Rating the photographs One hundred sixty raters (75 men and 85 women) took part in judging the photographs; they had no connection either to the Faculty of Science or the rated subjects and were aged 26.7 years on average (women: Mean± SD = 26.7±7.7, range: 15–58; men: Mean± SD = 26.7±7.5, range: 16–55). Of these, 43 women (Mean± SD = 27.1±8.8, range: 15–58) and 42 men (Mean± SD = 28.5±8.2, range: 20–55) judged the subjects for intelligence. Another 42 women (Mean± SD = 26.2±6.4, range: 21–51) and 33 men (Mean± SD = 24.5±5.7, range: 16–38) judged the photos for attractiveness. Every person rated the whole set of 80 photos, either for perceived intelligence or attractiveness, using a seven-point scale wherein 1 stands for the highest ranking (for intelligence or attractiveness) and 7 the lowest (intelligence or attractiveness). The presentation and judgment of all photographs were performed using the software ImageRater 1.1. The raters were individually invited to judge the photographs. Each rater saw the photographs on a computer screen and indicated their valuation by mouse clicks on a discrete seven-point scale. No time limit was imposed. The order of the photographs was randomized for each rater. In the situation where a rater knew or was acquainted with a person pictured, she/he was instructed not to rate that picture. To eliminate the influence of individual differences between raters, the ratings of all photographs evaluated by each rater were converted to z-scores and the perceived intelligence/attractiveness of each photographed subject was calculated as its average z-score. The z-scores of perceived intelligence and attractiveness ratings were normally distributed. Statistics The relationship between measured IQ and perceived intelligence was tested by linear regression models using a mean z-score of perceived intelligence as the dependent variable and IQ values as the independent variable. The age of photographed individuals and raters was added as a covariate. We measured a Pearson correlation between perceived intelligence and perceived attractiveness to estimate the intensity of the halo effect in our population. Perceived attractiveness was added to the model as a covariate, because perceived intelligence strongly correlates with attractiveness. Each of the intelligence components was tested separately for men and women. Both quadratic and linear models were fitted, their statistical plausibility evaluated by F-test and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The effect size of an explanatory variable was expressed by partial η2. Because the averaging of individual ratings can inflate the effect size of correlations [32], we have also calculated partial Pearson correlation between IQ and perceived intelligence for each rater with perceived attractiveness as a covariate and calculated average partial Pearson correlation for all raters. Significance level was estimated by permutation test with 10,000 randomizations. For each randomization, the order of values, represented by raters' assessment of perceived intelligence for 40 photos, was randomly changed. The partial Pearson correlation coefficient between permuted judgments of each rater and IQ values of photos was then computed and these correlation coefficients were averaged for all raters. A comparison of average correlation coefficient computed with original data with average coefficients computed from randomized sets of data (namely the fraction of higher or equal coefficients computed from randomized data sets) provided the statistical significance of the permutation test. For statistical analyses we used PASW/SPSS 18 and R statistical software version 2.13.2. For the permutation test we used Matlab v. 7.10.0.499. Geometric morphometrics Photographs of 40 men and 40 women were analyzed by geometric morphometric methods (GMM) in order to detect the facial features that are associated with either or both the perception of intelligence and intelligence measured with the Intelligence Structure Test in both men and women. The 72 landmarks (including 36 semilandmarks) were digitized by tpsDig2 software, ver. 2.14 [33]. Landmarks are represented as points that are anatomically (or at least geometrically) homologous in different individuals, while semilandmarks serve to denote curves and outlines. The definitions of landmark and semilandmark locations on human faces were derived from previous work [34]–[37]. Semilandmarks were slid by tpsRelw (ver. 1.49) software. All configurations of landmarks and semilandmarks were superimposed by generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), implemented in tpsRelw, ver. 1.46 [33]. This procedure standardized the size of the objects and optimized their rotation and translation so that the distances between corresponding landmarks were minimized. To observe the variation among the landmark data configurations of all specimens, the principal component analysis (PCA) – i.e., the relative warp analysis for parameter α = 0 – was carried out in tpsRelw, ver. 1.46. [33]. To observe the shape variation associated with perceived intelligence/IQ, we regressed GPA shape coordinates onto scores of intelligence rating/IQ by using a multivariate regression in which the dependent variable was the shape coordinates and the independent variable was perceived intelligence ratings or IQ scores; this was conducted in tpsRegr, ver. 1.36 [38]. Shape regressions were displayed by thin-plate splines as a deformation from the overall mean configuration (the consensus) of landmarks. The composite images were constructed by tpsSuper 1.14 [39] using the original photographs of men and women that were unwarped to fixed configuration represented by the estimates of shape regressions. \n \n Discussion Our raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher then chance from static facial photographs of men but not from photos of women. At the same time, we found no differences in the abilities of men and women to assess intelligence from static facial photos: the ratings of both sexes were highly correlated, r = 0.88. Perceived intelligence positively correlated with attractiveness in both men and women. Even though this contrasts some previous findings [10], [11], [40], [41], we did not observe any significant correlation between measured IQ and attractiveness. However, it should be noted that evidence for a relationship between actual intelligence and physical attractiveness in adults seems rather weak. Zebrowitz et al [10] did not find any significant correlation between perceived intelligence and attractiveness in individuals older than 18 years, i.e. middle adulthood (30 to 40) and later adulthood (52 to 60); however Zebrowitz et al did not examine individuals of a similar age bracket to our study (21.4 years in average). The existence of a correlation between attractiveness and intelligence in the age cohort from 19 to 29 years would appear questionable at the very least. Moreover, meta-analytic study has shown that physical attractiveness is not correlated to actual intellectual competence in adults, but is modestly correlated in children [15]. Similarly, other studies have reported close to zero correlation between attractiveness and actual intelligence in adults [40], [41]. We also showed that IQ has no statistically significant association in facial morphology in both men and women (at least as it was delimited by the landmark configuration used within this study). This means that our raters accurately assessed intelligence from faces of men based on visual cues that simply are not explicable from shape variability in men's faces. It is important to recall that our subjects were prompted to assume a neutral expression while their photo was taken and only photos of subjects with a neutral expression were included in the study. We can speculate about attributions of intelligence based on particular configurations of eyes or gaze, colour of eyes, hair and skin, or skin texture. These hypotheses should be tested in future studies. Intelligence stereotype Though we were not able to objectively detect an association between IQ and facial morphology, we can provide a statistically supported description of the stereotype of an intelligent-looking face. Our data suggest that a clear mental image how a smart face should look does exist for both men and women within the community of human raters. The intelligence-stereotype shows the same transformations in facial shape space for both men and women. In both sexes, a narrower face with a thinner chin and a larger prolonged nose characterizes the predicted stereotype of high-intelligence, while a rather oval and broader face with a massive chin and a smallish nose characterizes the prediction of low-intelligence (see Figs. 2 and 3). There also seems to be a correlation between semblances of emotions of joy or anger in perceptions of high or low intelligence in faces, respectively. The ‘high intelligence’ faces appear to be smiling more than the ‘low intelligence’ faces. A similar pattern was described for the perception of trustworthiness [37]. Perceived intelligence correlates with perceived trustworthiness and happiness. Conversely, low-intelligence faces are perceived as untrustworthy and considered angrier [42]. Moreover, perceived intelligence was also shown to be positively associated with perceived friendliness and sense of humour in both male and female faces but negatively related with perceived dominance in faces of women [43]. The face shape associated with a higher perception of intelligence also shows the characteristics of higher perception of attractiveness, while the face shape associated with a lower perception of intelligence shows traits of higher perceived dominance. The positive correlation with attractiveness and trustworthiness and negative correlation with dominance may explain the attribution of higher intelligence to longer, narrower faces. Correlation between IQ and perceived intelligence Two factors of general intelligence were significantly associated with perceived intelligence from men's faces: fluid intelligence and figural intelligence. Fluid intelligence is the capacity to logically solve problems independent of acquired knowledge [31]. It depends on a subject's genetic qualities and, largely, cannot be influenced by continuous exercise or life experience. Figural intelligence describes the ability to handle objects such as images, patterns, and shapes. One cannot explicitly say that figural intelligence is independent of experience acquired during life, though the nature of this ability would also be affected by heritable genetic cues (as well as nurturing or other environmental effects). By contrast, verbal and crystallized intelligence largely depend on the social environment. The quadratic shape of the negative relationship between perceived intelligence and IQ points at the constraints that limit the preference of men with a very high IQ. Men with an IQ higher than 140 are perceived as relatively less intelligent (see Fig. 4.), which can reflect an adaptation to an upper intelligence limit as men with an extremely high IQ could find such practical tasks, such as the care and protection of women and offspring, less rewarding. Though intelligence does not positively correlate with mental disorders or anomalies, there are some indications that extremely high intelligence combined with other factors such as creativity might carry a potential risk for various mental disorders [44]–[46]. In a future survey, it would be interesting to search for correlations between perceived intelligence and deviations from facial symmetry.

Graph demonstrating linear positive and quadratic negative relationship between IQ and perceived intelligence in men (a) and women (b). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081237.g004 If intelligence is judged with an accuracy higher than chance, and if intelligence is suggested to be at least partly heritable, we can then expect that intelligence could be an indicator of underlying genetic fitness with interesting consequences for human evolution [16], [17], [47], [48]. Our results necessarily imply the following question: Why does perceived intelligence reflect measured intelligence in men but not women. If facial indicators of intelligence are heritable, and if particular genes are not located on the Y sex chromosome, then both sons and daughters of an intelligent-looking father will obtain the alleles for an intelligent-looking face. One possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces, e.g. due to some genetic and developmental association to sex steroid hormonal agents during puberty [49]–[51]. If this is true, then the attribution of intelligence in infant faces should not differ between male and female children. When estimating the intelligence of women's faces, observers mechanically use criteria that “work” in men's faces, i.e. the criteria that objectively reflect intelligence in men. Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness. The strong halo effect of attractiveness may thus prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women. This seems to be supported by a significantly higher correlation of perceived intelligence with attractiveness in women's faces (r = 0.901) in comparison to that in men's faces (r = 0.502). The third possible explanation is that facial indicators of intelligence are signals rather than cues and that the honest signalling of intelligence is adaptive for men but not for women. It can be speculated, for example, that because of their mixed mating strategy, women prefer dominant men as extra-pair sexual partners while at the same time they seek men who are more willing to invest in their offspring as long-term or social partners [52]. It is known that while in the fertile phase of cycle and probably in search of good genes, women prefer creative intelligence to wealth especially in short-term mating [18]. On the other hand, a woman seeking a long term relationship could prefer a less intelligent but honest man, who compensates by long term provisioning, protection and a greater investment in childrearing. At the same time, the prevalence of the mixed mating strategy would influence so as to lead to frequency-dependent selection, and result in the stable coexistence of highly and lowly intelligent men within a population. To test this hypothesis, it will be necessary to search for correlations between women's preferences during their menstrual cycle and the IQ of their preferred partners. To conclude, humans were able to estimate actual intelligence from facial photographs of men but not women. The attractiveness ratings were not statistically related to measured intelligence in both men and women. No difference between men and women existed in the raters' ability to assess intelligence, and no specific traits that correlated with real intelligence were detected with standard geometric morphometric methods. Men and women with specific facial traits were perceived as highly intelligent. However, these faces of supposed high and low intelligence probably represent nothing more than a cultural stereotype because these morphological traits do not correlate with the real intelligence of the subjects. \n \n Acknowledgments We are grateful to all the students of Charles University in Prague who participated in the research. We thank Jan Havlíček and three anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions on earlier versions of this paper. We are also indebted to Jakub Kreisinger for valuable comments on statistical analyses and Jan Geryk for performing permutation tests.",
    "summary": "– It's easier to guess men's intelligence than women's just by looking at their faces—maybe because we're so distracted by female beauty, according to a new study. Czech researchers gave IQ tests to 80 male and female students, took photos of them, and asked 160 students to rate them in order of attractiveness and perceived intelligence, PsyPost reports. Generally, students deemed more attractive were also deemed smarter, especially among the women. Little surprise there, but somehow the 160 students were more able to spot men's actual IQ. Why is that? Maybe signs of higher intelligence are only visible in men's faces \"due to some genetic and developmental association,\" the researchers write. \"Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness,\" which prevents \"an accurate assessment of their intelligence.\" What's more, our ability to quickly identify a person's IQ may have \"evolutionary\" consequences, the researchers say, the Daily Mail reports. Neat factoid: The study found that people hold a certain mental image of an intelligent person's face—narrow, with a long nose and thin chin—which didn't correlate to actual IQ."

As part of the process, it was important to understand whether our current investors believed this would be a good strategic move and whether they would want to participate in a private Tesla. \n \n Our investors are extremely important to me. Almost all have stuck with us from the time we went public in 2010 when we had no cars in production and only a vision of what we wanted to be. They believe strongly in our mission to advance sustainable energy and care deeply about our success. \n \n I worked with Silver Lake, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who have world-class expertise in these matters, to consider the many factors that would come into play in taking Tesla private, and to process all the incoming interest that we received from investors to fund a go-private transaction. I also spent considerable time listening to current shareholders, large and small, to understand what they think would be in the best long-term interests of Tesla. \n \n Based on all the discussions that have taken place over the last couple of weeks and a thorough consideration of what is best for the company, a few things are clear to me: \n \n Given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company. Additionally, a number of institutional shareholders have explained that they have internal compliance issues that limit how much they can invest in a private company. There is also no proven path for most retail investors to own shares if we were private. Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was “please don’t do this.” \n \n I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it’s clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated. This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping Model 3 and becoming profitable. We will not achieve our mission of advancing sustainable energy unless we are also financially sustainable. \n \n That said, my belief that there is more than enough funding to take Tesla private was reinforced during this process. \n \n After considering all of these factors, I met with Tesla’s Board of Directors yesterday and let them know that I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public. The Board indicated that they agree. \n \n Moving forward, we will continue to focus on what matters most: building products that people love and that make a difference to the shared future of life on Earth. We’ve shown that we can make great sustainable energy products, and we now need to show that we can be sustainably profitable. With all the progress we’ve made on Model 3, we’re positioned to do this, and that’s what the team and I are going to be putting all of our efforts toward. \n \n Thank you to all of our investors, customers and employees for the support you’ve given our company. I’m incredibly excited to continue leading Tesla as a public company. It is a privilege. ||||| Tesla isn’t going private after all. \n \n In a statement late Friday night, Elon Musk, the electric-car maker’s chief executive, said he and the company’s board had concluded that they would not turn Tesla into a privately owned company. \n \n The move halts a process set in motion by Mr. Musk in a Twitter post on Aug. 7. The reversal is the latest upheaval for the company, which has struggled with production challenges for its first mass-market car, the Model 3. \n \n “I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it’s clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated,” Mr. Musk wrote in a statement that Tesla posted on the company’s blog shortly after 11 p.m. \n \n “After considering all these factors, I met with Tesla’s board of directors yesterday and let them know that I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public,” he said.",

Gaga wore a black, sleeveless gown and high heels, and with her hair piled up she towered over the Silicon Valley elites who were paying up to $35,800 per couple to attend. \n \n Gaga attended as a paying guest. She said last week that she wanted to meet with Obama to discuss her concerns about bullying, but it wasn't clear whether the two would be having that discussion. \n \n UPDATE: The White House traveling press corps pool offered additional information on Gaga's appearance at the event. The pop star sat in a middle table, standing when the President entered. Obama spoke for eight minutes, and did not acknowledge Gaga, but, according to the report, \"it seems likely the two crossed paths during greetings inside the house before the dinner.\" \n \n Given the outfit she was wearing, avoiding Gaga was probably impossible. \n \n \"She was wearing a floor-length sleeveless lacey black dress,\" the pool report relays, \"her blonde hair was gathered in a bouffant up-do adorned with a black hair piece with a black veil down the back, which she swept to the side and in front of her left shoulder.

But with no private pool, she immediately checked out and headed for The Palms Casino Resort. \n \n “She checked into the Cosmo, was unhappy with the room, checked out and then went to The Palms, but still wasn’t happy and was frantically searching for a new room,” a source told us. \n \n PHOTOS: LADY GAGA \n \n A Cosmopolitan spokesperson confirmed, “Lady Gaga did check out of the property, but she did not hate her room and had nothing but praise for the arrival staff, butlers, etc. She was looking for a private pool, which the resort doesn’t offer.” \n \n Gaga’s rep, Amanda Silverman, said: “It was not a whole drama. She moved to The Palms to do a recording. She had some meetings. She switched because she had stayed at The Palms before. It wasn’t like she hated her room, she doesn’t care about that stuff.” \n \n The Palms, where the lady monster is still staying for the weekend, comes equipped with a private recording studio. \n \n Gaga is in Las Vegas performing at the iHeartRadio music festival along with Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Coldplay, The Black Eyed Peas, Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, Kenny Chesney, Sting, Bruno Mars and Usher. \n \n Sources say arrangements around the concert, to promote the free online digital radio station, seemed chaotic. “It’s strangely radio silent,” a source said Friday. “Nobody, like the casino hosts, knows what’s going on with the concert. The set times haven’t been announced … Most of the artists … aren’t being paid and are more concerned with their deals at the nightclubs, which are paying them to perform later in the evening.”",

    "document": "The Caliente's Inaugural Season Had Blood, Sweat, Broken Bones, and a Lot of Lace \n \n In seconds, beauty morphs into brutality. \n \n The quarterback takes the ball and drops back three steps, right elbow cocked, eyes darting across the field. Anonka Dixon spots her favorite receiver, Tina Caccavale, but she's double-covered. The quarterback searches for another receiver but instead sees a tall defensive end barreling down hard. \n \n It's fourth down — 30 seconds until halftime, with the Miami Caliente down seven points — and the Chicago Bliss defense has applied relentless pressure to the quarterback. This will be Miami's last chance to score before halftime. As the seconds tick away, the sparse crowd speckled about the arena at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is tense. \n \n The quarterback tucks the ball to her ribs and squares her shoulders with the oncoming defender. A quick juke to the left sends the Chicago player flying by, a blur of orange jersey and blond hair. Dixon looks back down the field. A muscular 33-year-old born and raised in Miami, she always dreamed of playing full-contact football in front of a television audience. \n \n And she's doing it at last. In a skintight teal bikini made of satin and lace. With a bright number 12 on her butt and nothing at all on her toned legs and midriff. \n \n Anonka Dixon is the best player in the league. With lightning speed, the ability to plant either foot, pivot, and reverse field in a blink, and a right arm that can launch a perfect spiral 60 yards, she's the female version of Peyton Manning, Kurt Warner, and the good parts of Michael Vick all rolled into one. \n \n Dixon's receivers are crossing the field now, waving their hands, calling her name. She doesn't see the linebacker right behind her, but she somehow feels the pressure, spins backward to the right, and narrowly avoids the sack. She immediately cuts left again to slip another defender. \n \n She tucks the ball once more and charges past the line of scrimmage. Her receivers become blockers. She directs them with her left hand as she sprints through traffic, her legs turning faster than the high-definition cameras around the arena can pick up clearly. She speeds across the field, up the right sideline. \n \n Bliss safety Deborah Poles is tracking Dixon at an angle now, sprinting toward her. The two forces finally collide at the Chicago 13. They connect first at the shoulders, but in a split second, both bodies are parallel to the ground, feet in the air, their fate now up to gravity. \n \n The sound of the collision — a clap of plastic pads and helmets and the slap of human flesh — reverberates around the arena. There is an echo of \"oooohhh\"s. \n \n \"Bring it, bitch!\" yells a Chicago player in the aftermath of the hit. \"All night! All fucking night!\" \n \n Both players are slow to get up. Dixon lifts herself to one knee and flips the ball softly to the referee. The hit leaves her a bit stunned, her helmet and shoulder pads slightly ajar. She senses something is wrong and grabs the top of her right arm. She hasn't the time to worry about what will later be diagnosed as an \"acromioclavicular joint separation.\" She just got a first down. \n \n It's win or go home. The game is a playoff matchup for the right to represent the Eastern Conference in the inaugural Lingerie Football League championship game. What started as a one-off pay-per-view Super Bowl halftime alternative in 2004 is now an entire league in which ten satin-clad teams with names like Los Angeles Temptation, San Diego Seduction, and Dallas Desire each play a four-game schedule stretched over four months. \n \n This year's Lingerie Bowl, billed as \"The Ultimate Catfight\" and aired during halftime of Super Bowl XLIV, is available for $9.95 on the league's website. \n \n The two conference playoff games and the league championship were played a few days before Peyton Manning battled Drew Brees in Miami Gardens. Lingerie football can be nearly as brutal as the fully clothed men's game. These women deal with broken bones, torn ligaments, concussions, and a lot of nasty burns from playing on the indoor turf in underwear. Miami alone lost three players to torn ACLs this season. Add to that team drama, drunken fans, cheesy businessmen at the top of the league, and little money and the life of a lingerie football player is hardly beautiful. \n \n The women themselves are proportioned like quarterbacks and wide receivers but in a female form. They are ripped physical specimens, Amazon-like warriors geared for battle. \n \n Of course, the concept itself is as subtle as a 350-pound lineman. \"You have to consider the demographic of Super Bowl Sunday,\" says league founder and commissioner Mitch Mortaza. \"It's primarily men. And what are two great things that all men universally love? Beautiful women and football.\" \n \n The truth is, the public en masse isn't likely to feel comfortable watching or buying anything with Lingerie in the name any time soon. And there's something disturbing about seeing exquisitely toned young women with their most feminine physical attributes highlighted — the standard-issue uniform includes a lace garter, and the helmets have clear facemasks so the audience can see the women's faces — participating in what is otherwise exclusively male behavior. But most of the players, while acknowledging that the concept is exploitative — \"a man's sick dream,\" one player called it — insist that the game is a display of female empowerment. Sort of like burlesque. Or the way roller derby started as an excuse for men to watch women tussle in flapping skirts but now, for many, symbolizes a weird brand of feminism. ||||| \"Mr. Mortaza has a no non-sense [sic] approach and is extremely passionate about his league and is well respected amongst LFL players. If the LFL is such a horrible experience for its players which you certainly gave an impression of, let me ask you, why do so many return? Why are their [sic] players that have played since 2004? Why are the players that you featured coming back after apparently being placed on probation?\" \n \n \n \n Lingerie Football League executives, being the true arbiters of class and taste that they are, have put two of the best players in the league on probation for -- of all things -- having too much on during a recent photo shoot.Mariam Mortaza, sister of the league founder, recently informed both players involved in aphoto shoot that they are now on probation.This is a league where \"accidental nudity\" clauses are written into every contract and the players are often covered in baby oil before team photo shoots. So what, exactly, did these women do to upset league executives?They were photographed wearing shoulder pads. No, really.It was during a cover shoot for a recent New Times feature story on the Miami Caliente . Miami Caliente quarterback Anonka Dixon was featured on the cover of the Miami New Times . Tina Caccavale, Dixon's favorite receiver, was featured in New Times Broward-Palm Beach During games, the women wear shoulder pads, elbow pads, kneepads, and helmets. But when the women of the LFL are photographed, the league generally has them wear only the satin bra and underwear. For the photos accompanying our story, which details the lives of a few lingerie football players as well as the history of the league, we encouraged the women to wear their shoulder pads to look like the fierce athletes they are.An email I received from Stephon McMillen, media director for the LFL, explains that the players are in trouble because they were photographed wearing shoulder pads and a Nike wristband \"without authorization.\"The photo shoot was arranged with the league beforehand. During the week of the LFL playoffs, I spoke with several league officials about the story and the photo shoot, including McMillen, league founder and President Mitch Mortaza, and another league public relations representative. They were all cooperative.It seems the league wasn't pleased with the article, though. In the email from McMillen, I was informed that I \"personally have been banned from being credentialed to cover any LFL or Miami Caliente events and/or games.\"According to McMillen,is now banned because we wrote about Mortaza's appearance on the reality showten years ago and because: \"You failed to focus on any of Mr. Mortaza's success' [sic] such as launching a women's tackle football league in a tough economical [sic] environment and its growth in 2010.\" He added:Dixon had better stats than any other player in the league during the inaugural season, and she accounted for more than 80 percent of Miami's touchdowns. Caccavale led the league in both receptions and interceptions. So apparently the team is willing to punish their firepower if they do something as diabolical as stand for a photograph while they wear shoulder pads.",
    "summary": "– Players in the Lingerie Football League wear pads on the field, but apparently not in photo shoots—and now two of the best players are on probation for doing exactly that. An LFL rep says Miami Caliente quarterback Anonka Dixon and receiver Tina Caccavale are in trouble for wearing shoulder pads and a Nike wristband on a cover shoot without authorization, but the real problem might be league founder Mitch Mortaza’s unhappiness with the original article. After all, “This is a league where ‘accidental nudity’ clauses are written into every contract and the players are often covered in baby oil before team photo shoots,” writes Michael J. Mooney, who wrote the piece that accompanied the offending cover for the Broward-Palm Beach New Times (and says the league was cooperative) and has since been “banned” from covering future LFL events. The issue? Mooney wrote about Mortaza’s appearance on reality show Blind Date, but “failed to focus on any of Mr. Mortaza’s success,” the rep says."

    "document": "With reproductive rights under threat, Women Help Women gives legal and medical advice to women who may be taking matters into their own hands \n \n New website offers US women help to perform their own abortions \n \n Fearful that Donald Trump’s presidency poses a once-in-a-generation threat to US reproductive rights, an international advocacy group this week is unveiling what is sure to be a controversial response: a web portal dedicated to helping US women terminate their own pregnancies with abortion-inducing drugs they have obtained outside of a medical setting. \n \n ‘Please, I am out of options’: inside the murky world of DIY abortions Read more \n \n The project, launched by Women Help Women, is a nod to the fact that many US women may already be taking matters into their own hands as abortion options in this country contract. \n \n “Women in the US have been and are using the pills without good guidance,” said Susan Yanow, the US spokeswoman for the group, Women Help Women. “If a woman is anxious and has the pills in her hand, and doesn’t know what to do … we can help her understand what to do. We can help her understand what signs to look for, and what’s going on.” \n \n Research suggests that there is a small but significant number of US women who attempt to induce their own abortions without any medical supervision. \n \n Several studies have shown that many of these women, particularly those living along the US-Mexico border, are using misoprostol, a miscarriage-causing drug that can be legally purchased over the counter in many Central American pharmacies. In the US, it is illegal to administer the drug outside of certain medical clinics. \n \n Rules for taking misoprostol are easy to find online. What Women Help Women has done differently is connect US women with counselors who can provide step-by-step instructions, and answer questions, in real time. \n \n Their counselors are trained by medical professionals to walk women through the process of using misoprostol for a DIY abortion. Counselors will also strive to connect women with abortion funds if payment is the main obstacle for getting an abortion in a clinic. \n \n But the main goal is to support the unknown numbers of women who are performing their abortions themselves. \n \n Part of the inspiration, Yanow said, came from an article the Guardian US published in November. The story followed a young Texas woman who, unable to afford an abortion in the US, traveled to Mexico to purchase an abortion-inducing drug over the counter. \n \n “There’s just so many questions,” the woman told the Guardian. “I would so much rather have a health professional help me in this and kind of guide me through it versus DIY.” \n \n New Brunswick becomes first Canada province to offer free abortion pill Read more \n \n Those words stuck in Yanow’s mind. And as she grappled for a way to respond to November’s election, it occurred to her that Women Help Women could tailor its services to the needs of women in the US. \n \n The project will be titled Self-managed Abortion, Safe and Supported, or SASS, and use the website abortionpillinfo.org. \n \n Women Help Women is already a longstanding provider of abortion pills and instructions in other countries. Every month, its staff members answer 5,000 emails from women around the globe seeking to end their own pregnancies. \n \n The group will not provide abortion-inducing drugs to women in the US. And it has made other changes to its methods because of the United States’ uniquely hostile, anti-abortion atmosphere. \n \n In the US, at least 18 women have been charged with a crime based on allegations that they attempted to induce their own abortion. A handful of states have made it explicitly illegal for anyone but certain medical professionals to administer abortion-inducing drugs. \n \n Enterprising prosecutors have found other, creative ways to levy charges, through the use of laws against child endangerment, practicing medicine without a license, or drug possession. \n \n Women Help Women counselors will inform clients of some of the legal risks that come with self-administering misoprostol, as well as some of the limitations. \n \n But the legal implications of the project are far from certain. \n \n “This area of the law is nothing if not complicated,” said Jill Adams, the chief strategist of the the Self-Induced Abortion Legal Team, a project associated with Berkeley Law. Her group has shared legal information about self-induced abortion with Women Help Women, but stopped short of legally vetting the information that counselors will provide to US women. \n \n In general, the act of looking for or giving out information about self-inducing an abortion is protected by law, Adams said. And she knows of no one who has been prosecuted merely for seeking information. \n \n Still, it could compound the risk of prosecution. Purvi Patel, the first US woman to receive a significant prison sentence for inducing her own abortion, was convicted after prosecutors obtained emails that showed her purchasing an abortion-inducing drug from a Chinese pharmacy. \n \n With those facts in mind, Women Help Women designed its portal to delete conversations between clients and counselors after seven days.Its servers are located abroad – out of easy reach for US prosecutors, the thinking goes – as are all 23 of its counselors. \n \n The legal risks are thought to loom larger than the medical risks. \n \n “In general, I would say there’s kind of a growing recognition that from a safety or a medical perspective, we have very few concerns about” women using abortion drugs on their own, said Daniel Grossman, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California–San Francisco who researches self-induced abortion. \n \n “Especially if we’re talking about women using misoprostol on their own. It’s a very safe and effective medication,” he continued. “If women have information about how to use it, then women can safely use it on their own.” \n \n When women go to an abortion clinic, they are typically given two drugs: mifepristone, a drug that blocks hormones necessary to sustain a pregnancy administered in person, and misoprostol, which is taken many hours later and causes the uterus to contract and expel its contents. The Food and Drug administration permits women to leave the clinic and take misoprostol at home. \n \n \n \n \n \n Researchers believe that women who self-administer abortion drugs are most likely taking misoprostol by itself, because it is easy to obtain from foreign pharmacies. Misoprostol used without mifepristone is less likely to cause an abortion but still has a high success rate. \n \n There are certain medical risks in self-administering an abortion drug without the involvement of medical professionals. An ultrasound is often necessary to confirm a pregnancy and assess how many weeks a woman has been pregnant. Misoprostol is less effective and requires a different drug regimen later in the first trimester. \n \n Medical professionals will also inform women about how to recognize complications, like excessive bleeding, that could occur after they leave the clinic and require medical attention. And using the drug improperly – say, at a high dose in the second trimester – can lead to serious medical complications. \n \n Grossman argued that a project like Women Help Women’s could minimize those risks. “I think that it’s worse to just remain silent while we know women are doing this,” he said. \n \n But abortion rights opponents cite these safety concerns as reasons to oppose any project that makes abortion drugs available outside a clinical setting. \n \n In response to a study, first reported by the Guardian, that tests the efficacy of sending women abortion drugs by mail, a spokeswoman for Americans United for Life said, “We have grave concerns about handing out dangerous, life-ending drugs without medical supervision because women face great risks for chemical abortions.” \n \n Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, asked, “Who are they supposed to call if they have a problem?” \n \n Yanow says that’s exactly the point of Women Help Women’s new portal. \n \n “People are not being advised to use the pills,” she said. “They’re being advised if they’ve already decided to use the pills. What drives this project is the knowledge that women have been managing this on their own.” ||||| “Hello. I just found out that I am four weeks pregnant. \n \n “I cannot carry on with this pregnancy for numerous reasons and I want to have an abortion. Though it is an option for me in the United States, in reality, it is not really an option because the $600-$700 to have it done is simply out of the question. \n \n “I’m hoping you can advise me and are able to help. I am absolutely desperate.” \n \n Martina read through her email once again and hovered her finger over the send button. The message was addressed half a world away to Women on Web, a Dutch not-for-profit group that mails abortion drugs to pregnant women who live in countries where abortion is outlawed. \n \n Martina lives in Texas, where abortion is restricted but legal – making it one of the places where Women on Web refuses to mail the drugs. Still, Martina thought she would try her luck. She had lost her job to downsizing, and in its place she had found only part-time work. Her rent had gone up. Lately, she was borrowing money for gas. \n \n There was no question that she couldn’t afford to have a child. The question was whether she could even afford an abortion. \n \n Martina had an inkling that what she was asking for – help performing her own abortion – might not be fully legal. But she was out of answers. She hit send. Then she began to case the internet for other ways she could cause her own abortion. \n \n If this scene feels out of place in 2016, that may be because there was a time in this country’s history when thousands of back-alley and coat-hanger abortions prompted calls for the procedure to be legal. After the US supreme court established a right to a legal abortion, in the 1973 decision Roe v Wade, self-induced abortions were supposed to become a thing of the past. \n \n But almost as soon as the court legalized abortion, opponents of abortion rights began to whittle them away. Congress began prohibiting poor women from using Medicaid to cover abortions in September 1976. Obamacare, the largest healthcare expansion in decades, allowed insurers to continue to pick and choose the circumstances under which they would cover abortion and allowed states to ban the coverage altogether. The two decisions have ensured that millions of women who have sought an abortion have had to pay for it out of pocket. And a sweeping wave of anti-abortion laws has closed clinics in many states, cresting with an awesome force over the last five years. \n \n In such a hostile climate, it is no wonder that self-induced abortions are still a significant, if largely hidden phenomenon – one that even pro-abortion rights groups are only just beginning to grasp. One study of abortion patients found that 2.2% had tried to, at some point in their lives, induce their own abortions without professional medical assistance. Another estimated that potentially 4.1% of Texas women have tried to self-induce – or at least 100,000 women. \n \n There is no concrete data on how many women in the US have tried to self-induce. But there is some evidence – although it is inconclusive – to suggest that self-abortion attempts are on the rise. From 2008 to 2011, as the economy worsened and a wave of new restrictions choked abortion access around the country, online queries about self-induced abortion almost doubled, according to Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, an economist who analyzes Google searches. \n \n Into this crisis of reproductive rights now walks Donald Trump. As president, Trump has promised to restrict abortion even further. He has vowed to nominate justices to the supreme court who might overturn Roe v Wade. Roe, because the court is loath to reverse itself, has survived such threats before. But Trump has explicitly promised to nominate justices who might put Roe in their crosshairs. \n \n In his first major interview after winning office, Trump described – truthfully – what might happen to some women if Roe v Wade were overturned. “They’ll perhaps have to go, they’ll have to go to another state,” he said. “And that’s OK?” he was asked. Trump replied, “Well, we’ll see what happens.” \n \n But we don’t have to wait and see what happens. History has already shown us what happens when women in the US can’t access abortion. So has the present day. \n \n In 2015 alone, Women on Web, the Dutch not-for-profit, received more than 600 emails from US women looking for a way to end their own pregnancies. (The group does not send abortion drugs to the US, because the US does not outright ban abortion.) Women on Web agreed to share scores of these emails with the Guardian, providing an unprecedented window into the lives of women who feel they have no other option but to end their pregnancies themselves. \n \n Among the hundreds who wrote to Women on Web was Martina. She contacted the Guardian shortly after she found out about her unwanted pregnancy and shared every step of her journey, which eventually took her across an international border. (As corroboration, she provided photographs, including of her travel documents. Her name has been changed for her privacy.) She wasn’t sure if she faced a potential legal risk. And in fact, self-induction is in a legal gray area, and many enterprising prosecutors have charged women who carried out their own abortions with crimes. Nevertheless, Martina felt compelled to speak. \n \n “I feel like there’s such a negative stigma to this,” she said. “It’s kind of kept under the radar, hushed, so it needs to be talked about.” People needed to know, she added, that abortion restrictions had real victims. “You’re not really helping anyone. You’re not really protecting anyone. You’re just causing women who are in these situations who feel desperate to take desperate measures.” \n \n The letters to Women on Web form a uniform chorus of desperation. “Please” and “afford” and “help” and “fear” appear in dozens of places, signaling the nature of how these women became stranded. \n \n “now he is threatening me, saying I can never leave.” “I am afraid of what he is capable of.” “For a variety of reasons, an abortion must look like a miscarriage.” “this has to look like a miscarriage.” “I don’t have $600.” “Planned Parenthood wants $650. My bf and I live in our car.” “I can’t afford an abortion.” “I simply cannot afford an abortion.” \n \n A teenager in a state where minors need parental consent for an abortion said her parents were forcing her to have her baby. \n \n A woman in Missouri wrote to say that she had gone to her state’s only abortion clinic, “but the protestors shamed me into going back. I’m not a citizen and its a little scary coz I feel very lonely.” \n \n “I am beside myself,” read another woman’s email. One month before she wrote her email, she was raped. She received her coverage through Tricare, the insurance plan for military personnel and their families. Tricare’s policy is to cover abortion in cases of rape as long as a doctor has a “good faith belief” that the rape occurred, according to a spokesman. But this woman wrote that Tricare refused to pay for her abortion on the basis that she never reported the rape. \n \n “To end this nightmare,” she wrote, “it would cost me one-third of my family’s monthly income.” She continued, “I have seen a doctor. I have had a sonogram. Tricare covers that. I can give birth to my rapist’s baby for free.” \n \n “Please I am out of options,” the letters read. \n \n “Can u please.” “please please please.” “I cry and pray every night that the Lord take this child from me somehow.” “I will keep searching online for help.” \n \n What is striking about reading these emails one after another after another is the diversity of experiences that lead all these women down the same path. There are homeless women and middle-class women and married women and single women, women living in cities and women separated from the nearest abortion provider by an ocean: two wrote in from the big island of Hawaii, where the last clinic, a Planned Parenthood in Kailua-Kona, closed in 2014. \n \n “When people think about low-income women seeking abortion, they have this stereotypical vision of a single woman on welfare,” said Laurie Bertram Roberts, head of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund. Her group provides financial assistance for abortions. “But it’s also people who have two jobs. Six hundred dollars is a lot of fucking money. For a lot of the people who call us – not a majority, but many – those barriers are just too high. Even with our help.” \n \n Women on Web wrote back to Martina a few hours after she sent her message. “We’re sorry,” the reply came, “Women on Web cannot provide the service in any country with safe abortion services.” The email listed a few not-for-profit abortion funds Martina could call for financial assistance. Then it recommended another option: “If you live close to Mexico you can also travel to Mexico to buy misoprostol,” a drug that can induce a miscarriage early in a pregnancy. \n \n It sounded like a gamble. Martina felt a jolt of fear. “What if it’s incomplete? What if I do it wrong? What if I fuck up my organs somehow?” She pushed these thoughts aside. At least it was an option. \n \n Martina learned that her insurance would not cover her abortion and left messages with two abortion funds. She also found a world of websites describing ways to induce abortions with herbs or vitamins. Following advice from the sources that looked the most reputable, she began taking cinnamon capsules and several thousand milligrams of vitamin C per day. \n \n It’s not unheard of for women to turn to herbal concoctions, reproductive rights advocates said. “It’s considered an OK thing to do – this is just how they’ve handled it for years,” said Esther Priegue, the director of counseling at Choices Women’s Medical Center, an abortion clinic in Queens. Her patients occasionally use an herbal brew to try to induce a miscarriage. \n \n The internet resounds with such recipes. “What you probably have, in reality, is hundreds of people doing it hundreds of different ways,” said Beverly Winikoff, the president of Gynuity Health Projects, a reproductive rights research group. “The way it’s always been.” \n \n Of course, there weren’t supposed to be hundreds of different ways. \n \n Self-induced abortion was supposed to have all but disappeared after the supreme court established the right to an abortion throughout the country. In the run-up to Roe v Wade, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, abortion was restricted to a handful of major cities and the women with the means to travel there. Roughly 100,000 women crossed state lines for a legal abortion in New York state; in a single year, the number of women going to illegal providers or trying to self-induce was up to 12 times that. Some years, up to 200 women would die of complications from illegal or self-induced abortions. And compared with the number of women who survived horrific complications, that figure appears small. In 1968 alone, a single Los Angeles County hospital treated 701 women suffering from septic abortions. \n \n But just a few years after Roe, the country seemed to vanquish the coat-hanger abortion. In 1976, the Centers for Disease Control announced that only three women had died the previous year from abortion complications – a stunning reduction in deaths. When anti-abortion activists accused the centers of undercounting, the CDC, according to the book Inside the Outbreaks, put up a $100 bounty for proof of any abortion death the centers had failed to report. “We paid out zero money,” one official recalled proudly. \n \n But others realized that, even though women were no longer dying in scandalous numbers, illegal and self-induced abortions were still a serious problem. \n \n The CDC announcement came out the same year Dr Jason Doe began to do his medical residency. In the remote north-west corner of Louisiana, he rotated through an obstetrics ward that received many of the area’s most impoverished residents. The state’s only abortion clinic stood in the opposite corner of the state. “So even though abortion technically was legal” for those women, “it wasn’t available,” Doe said. \n \n One of his first patients had unraveled a wire coat hanger and used it to break her water. Another broke her water with a red rubber catheter her friend had stolen from a hospital. \n \n Doe’s memory of another patient is dominated by her screams. As she seized in pain, doctors removed an intact cotton boll – the husk was still attached – from her vagina. She had soaked the cotton fibers in turpentine and honey. \n \n “In three years, I suppose I saw a dozen cases,” said Doe. (Doe agreed to speak only under a pseudonym. He works as an abortion provider in Shreveport and has kept his identity hidden from the public.) He treated women who had gone to back-alley abortion providers and a woman who had shot herself in the stomach. Turpentine became a kind of harrowing motif. One woman used a syringe to inject it into her abdomen. The tide only ceased in 1980, when two abortion clinics opened a few months apart in nearby Bossier City and Shreveport. Roe v Wade was seven years old. \n \n “Just making it legal is not enough,” Doe said. “If it’s not available, if a woman really does feel that she needs to terminate her pregnancy, she may be willing to try just about anything.” \n \n His were not isolated experiences. In 1977, Rosie Jimenez became one of the first women to die from an illicit abortion after Roe v Wade. Jimenez had previously had one legal abortion, paid for using Medicaid. But in 1976, Congress passed the Hyde amendment, which banned the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for abortion and which many advocates still consider the country’s biggest barrier to abortion access today. The next time Jimenez became pregnant, she sought out an unlicensed midwife in McAllen, Texas. She died of a bacterial infection. \n \n In fact, nearly every year after Roe v Wade brought isolated reports of a woman taking drastic steps to terminate her pregnancy. 1978: Three young women in Colorado poisoned their livers by drinking tiny amounts of aromatherapy oil to try to induce an abortion. 1984: A teenager injected herself with a local anesthetic and attempted to cut out her fetus. 1994: A Florida teenager placed a pillow over her abdomen and shot herself in the side. \n \n Earlier this month, a woman in Tennessee was charged with aggravated assault for trying to give herself an abortion with a coat hanger. She was found out after profuse bleeding sent her to the emergency room. \n \n It is against this backdrop of tragedies that some reproductive rights activists have argued for making the same abortion drugs used routinely in clinics available to women in their homes. “It would be phenomenal if people could receive this medication in the mail with all the instructions” and the right safety measures, said Yamani Hernandez, the executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds. Already, she added, the internet is allowing untold numbers of to find and use the drug without medical supervision. Among the 700,000 searches on self-abortion Stephens-Davidowitz identified in 2015, some 160,000 were searches for a way to obtain the abortion pill through back channels. \n \n Is there a chance those searches could increase under a Trump presidency? “Yes,” said Hernandez. “That is something that one could reasonably predict in an environment where abortion becomes even illegal, or even more inaccessible than it has been. We will do anything in our power to get people the information and the care that they need.” Even now, her group posts instructions for self-administering misoprostol on its website – “For safety’s sake.” \n \n Not all advocates feel good about disseminating this information. But they consider it better than the alternatives. \n \n Recently, Roberts answered one of the “scariest calls” of her advocacy career. A young woman was on the line, saying her friend had given her a home remedy. Her friend claimed to have used this method to end four separate pregnancies, even though each time it sent her to the hospital. \n \n “Ultimately, we helped this woman go to a clinic” before she could do something dangerous, Roberts said. “Her friend had told her to drink turpentine with sugar.” \n \n At a crisis pregnancy center, an ultrasound confirmed that Martina’s home remedies hadn’t worked. She was still pregnant. The distress must have shown on her face, because the technician offered a flurry of reassurances. They see a lot of single moms who do it on their own. They have a store that sells baby clothes at a markdown. They help with discounts on daycare. Martina fumed. A baby is more than just buying clothes and food, she thought. \n \n In her head, she was already reviewing her plan. She had heard back from only one abortion fund, which had turned her down for assistance because she had a job. And so, for a quarter of what a US abortion clinic would charge, she had purchased a flight to Mexico City. The flight left the next day. She would stay with a friend. Abortion pills would cost about $20 at a pharmacy – if she could find a pharmacy that carried the drug and would sell it to a young woman. \n \n Then, she would take the drugs at her friend’s house. “I’m gonna say like, ‘Oh man, I’m on my period, I’m so sorry, I hate that this is ruining the trip, I feel so sick,’” she said, sounding perfectly unrehearsed. \n \n Martina had relied on this kind of subterfuge for the past several weeks. Friends had noticed she was distracted. Her boss had noticed she was nauseous. “This whole time that I’ve been pregnant, and that I’ve known I’ve been pregnant, that’s all I’ve thought about,” she said. “I’ve almost cried like five times today.” But you have to push that aside and act like you’re fine, she said: “Oh yeah, I’m sorry, I was zoned out for a sec.” “Oh yeah, sorry, just not feeling great.” \n \n The more difficult challenge was hiding her pregnancy from her boyfriend. She knew he would want to start a family. At home, she was taking so much anti-nausea medication to keep from vomiting in front of him that she no longer had enough to sustain her through the work day. \n \n “You feel alone, but you can’t do anything about it,” she said. “I just kind of have to put my feeling outside of it. You need to focus. What do you need to do in order to move forward? \n \n “It’s kind of like when you’re drowning. If you just flap around, you’re just going to drown. But if you focus on what the goal is, on what you need to do, stay calm, that’s how you’re going to survive.” \n \n It was the sixth pharmacy Martina went to in Mexico that sold her the misoprostol. The first five, a mix of big national chains and mom and pop shops, claimed they didn’t carry it. She felt at least one pharmacist was lying to her. Finally, she returned to the first store to ask, if not here, where could she buy it? \n \n A little while later, she paid $26 for a blue carton about the size of her hand. Misoprostol, it said. Caja con 28 tabletas. \n \n It wasn’t an exciting feeling, holding the box. It was scary, Martina said. “It’s just like a God-I-just-want-to-get-this-over-with” feeling. She was still too nauseous to take the pills while she was in Mexico City, so she would have to take them in the United States. It was a panicky moment, bringing pills back through customs. But there was a larger fear. \n \n “My biggest concern is, what happens if someone finds out? What happens if something goes wrong?” Martina had said a few days earlier. “What happens if my body doesn’t completely rid itself?” In most abortion clinics, she knew, a medication abortion was induced with two drugs: one drug to terminate the pregnancy, and misoprostol to expel the pregnancy. She would only be taking the misoprostol. “So basically, you’re half-assing the job.” \n \n She knew what symptoms would tell her something had gone wrong. But still. “There’s just so many questions. I would so much rather have a health professional help me in this and kind of guide me through it versus DIY. There’s some things aren’t meant for that, and this is definitely one of them.” \n \n It is impossible to know what happened to all the other women who reached out to Women on Web. But a study of women who were rejected because they were past the clinic’s gestational limit found that most of them carried their pregnancies to term. \n \n Roberts, the Mississippi activist, said that many women who struggle to pay for an abortion eventually get creative. Not long ago, she spoke to a mother who was weighing whether to raid her diaper fund to pay for her abortion. It was unlikely her parents would lend her money for an abortion, she reasoned, but they would probably help her buy more diapers. \n \n “There are no more creative problem solvers, and I mean this, than women with no money,” she said. “And I’m saying that with the utmost respect, because there are people who will think of all this as shady. And I’m not. I’ve seen people struggling, and being brilliant, brilliant, in coming up with ways to survive.” It’s a skill she fears more women might need in the future. \n \n Martina’s trip had cost a fraction of the money she needed to raise for an abortion in a US clinic – something her mind was still trying to grasp. “The whole time I was traveling, I couldn’t believe it was happening,” she said. \n \n We were speaking a few days after she returned from Mexico. An ultrasound had just confirmed that she was no longer pregnant, and her voice was sunny. “I am so relieved, to be honest.” She hadn’t realized, until she was no longer pregnant, how much stress she had placed on herself. Now, she felt like she could breathe, she said. Like she could step back on the path of her life and figure out where she had been when she diverged. \n \n Martina had taken the pills on a Saturday. She took the first dose. She set a timer on her phone. Then she took the second dose. \n \n The pills worked just like they were supposed to. She bled, but not too much. She felt the pregnancy pass. She felt exhausted. \n \n \n \n And then it was done. ||||| Share \n \n In the U.S., abortion is legal in every state, and every state has at least one clinic that provides abortion care.

    "summary": "– A Dutch organization that advises women on reproductive rights has now launched a website to help US women terminate pregnancies on their own. The Guardian reports on the \"Self-Managed Abortion: Safe and Supported\" portal, or SASS, set up by Women Help Women. Through it, 23 trained counselors will answer questions and give advice if women have already decided to take the drug misoprostol. The medication, which, when taken alone or in combination with mifepristone, keeps a pregnancy from happening, is only legal in the US at medical facilities, though it can be purchased OTC in Central American nations. A Women Help Women rep says the idea for the site came about after a Guardian story documenting a Texas woman's trip to Mexico to get the drug, and all the questions she had once she got it. The site won't provide pills, and organizers say they won't even suggest women take them—they're just there to keep women safe if they've already decided to. \"It's worse to just remain silent,\" says a UC San Francisco obstetrics professor who calls misoprostol a \"very safe and effective\" drug (though it's more effective taken with mifepristone, which isn't as easy to obtain). For women who do have complications and must seek medical care, the Washington Post notes they'll be advised that drug-induced and spontaneous abortions typically look the same, and that the drug isn't detectable via drug test. Abortion foes note the meds can be dangerous if not taken correctly or if taken late in the gestation period, and that this site could put women at risk by providing info on taking them. Women Help Women is being cautious in case of legal ramifications: Its servers are located outside the US, as are its two dozen or so staffers."

    "document": "Martin funeral director: No signs of fight on body \n \n (CBS News) SANFORD, Florida - The defense of George Zimmerman rests on a violent fight that he said occurred before he fired the shot that killed Trayvon Martin. \n \n Zimmerman is neighborhood watch volunteer at the center of the case. It was almost five weeks that Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old, was killed after Zimmerman found him suspicious. We don't know what happened immediately immediately before the shot was fired. CBS News correspondent Mark Strassman has new evidence in the case. \n \n Trayvon Martin was buried in Miami with a gunshot wound to his chest. But otherwise, according to Richard Kurtz, the funeral director who prepared Martin for burial, his body showed no injuries. \n \n \"We could see no physical signs like there had been a scuffle [or] there had been a fight,\" he said. \"The hands -- I didn't see any knuckles, bruises or what have you. And that is something we would have covered up if it would have been there.\" \n \n Video shows Zimmerman with cops; Dad speaks out \n \n Complete coverage: The shooting of Trayvon Martin \n \n And as a surveillance tape shows, George Zimmerman in handcuffs, 40 minutes after he killed Trayvon Martin. He seemed to show no apparent injuries, either. \n \n Yet Zimmerman claims Martin beat him and threatened his life, so he shot the teenager in self-defense. \n \n But Ben Crump, the lawyer for Martin's parents, said the video shows a murderer. \n \n \"Look at that video,\" he said. \"Do you see any blood on his head? He said he broke his nose. Look at that video. And look at how easy he walks out of the car.\" \n \n Zimmerman, a crime watch volunteer, thought Martin looked suspicious, called police, and followed Martin along a street and around a corner. \n \n Robert Zimmerman, the gunman's father, told WOFL-TV in Orlando that Martin suddenly confronted his son. \n \n Watch the full interview with Richard Kurtz, the funeral director who prepared Trayvon Martin's body for burial, below: \n \n \"At that point he was punched in the nose,\" he said. \"His nose was broken. and he was knocked to the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and just started beating him in the face and in the nose, hitting his head on the concrete.\" \n \n Police reports noted Zimmerman was \"bleeding from the nose and the back of the head.\" But a closer look at Zimmerman shows no obvious head or face injuries. At one point, an officer does check the back of his head. \n \n Martin's family contends this video proves police never wanted to arrest Zimmerman. \n \n And Cheryl Brown said a widespread perception is wrong: Sanford police wanted to charge Zimmerman. She identified Chris Serino as the lead investigator who questioned people in the neighborhood. \n \n \"Detective Serino -- did you have the sense when he interviewed you that he thought it was a killing in self-defense?\" Strassmann asked Brown. \n \n \"No, because he actually stated to me in my family room that 'we do not believe it was self-defense and we need to prove it,'\" said Brown. \n \n A special prosecutor will now decide whether Zimmerman deserves to be charged. Zimmerman's father insists his son is also a victim here. \n \n \"...They are just making up stuff that are not true about George. How he is being portrayed is an absolute lie.\" \n \n Robert Zimmerman said Martin beat his son for more than one minute. And when his son fired his .9-mm, Robert Zimmerman said it was because he had no choice. ||||| About this Show: \n \n Anderson Cooper goes beyond the headlines to tell stories from many points of view, so you can make up your own mind about the news.

First, the funeral director who prepared Martin's body for burial said he observed no signs of a struggle, reports CBS News. Aside from the gunshot wound to the chest, \"We could see no physical signs like there had been a scuffle,\" he explained. \"The hands—I didn't see any knuckles, bruises, or what have you. And that is something we would have covered up if it would have been there.\" Also: The mother of a key 13-year-old eyewitness in the case says that police pressured her son to tell them details he hadn't seen, reports the New York Daily News. He saw just one person in the grass, she says, and couldn't tell who it was \"because it was too dark.\" But the police persisted, giving the boy a multiple choice question about the color of the sweater he saw. Of the three options, he told them he thought it might be red—the color Zimmerman was wearing. \"I believe he felt pressured to give the color,\" says mom. An anonymous eyewitness spoke to Anderson Cooper last night. He says Zimmerman didn't seem injured as he walked away. More news from the past: Zimmerman was fired in 2005 from an under-the-counter security guard job because he \"had a temper and he became a liability,\" a former co-worker tells the New York Daily News. The man described Zimmerman as \"like Jekyll and Hyde,\" saying, \"When the dude snapped, he snapped. He definitely loved being in charge. He loved the power. Still, I could never see him killing someone. Never,\" he said."

    "document": "A ranger from the Kenya Wildlife Service shoots dead a male lion that had strayed from the Nairobi National Park, in Kajiado, Kenya Wednesday, March 30, 2016. A lion was shot dead in Kenya on Wednesday... (Associated Press) \n \n JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A lion was shot dead in Kenya on Wednesday after attacking a man, while trackers in South Africa searched for a lion whose escape from a park prompted appeals to wildlife officials to relocate it rather than kill it. \n \n The two cases of African lions on the loose highlight the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century because of unregulated hunting, a loss of habitat and growing conflict with livestock herders. Concern about the threatened species intensified last year when an American dentist killed a lion named Cecil in a hunt in Zimbabwe that officials said was illegal. \n \n The circumstances of the stray lions also fueled questions about whether to dart a potentially dangerous predator with a tranquilizer and return it to a fenced area, or kill it before it can attack people. Such decisions depend on factors including the training of wildlife experts, their resources and whether the area where a lion is roaming is densely populated. In some cases, local residents have killed lions before officials arrived on the scene. \n \n Wildlife officials in Kenya shot the escaped lion several times after it injured a man in the Kajiado district, near Nairobi, the capital, said Paul Udoto, a spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service. \n \n Officials had planned to capture the lion, but the animal become too agitated by the noise of a gathering crowd and had to be killed, he said. \n \n Another senior Kenyan wildlife official, Kitili Mbathi, blamed a faulty electrical fence for the lion's escape from Nairobi National Park. \n \n However, a later statement from the Kenya Wildlife Service said the lion was killed in a wildlife migration area outside the park's southern section, which is not fenced, and that the lion was trying to establish new territory. The 13-year-old male lion named Mohawk had recently been involved in territorial fights, according to the statement. \n \n The lion struck a 27-year-old man on a motorcycle who was among 400 people surrounding the lion, the wildlife service said. The man suffered deep lacerations on his back as well as bruises from falling off the bike, it said. \n \n It was the second incident this month involving a stray lion in Kenya. On March 18, a lion mauled a pedestrian in Nairobi before being captured. Nairobi National Park, which covers 117 square kilometers (45 square miles) on the outskirts of the city, is home to endangered black rhinos, lions, leopards, cheetahs, giraffes and diverse birdlife. The park is under growing pressure as the city expands. \n \n In South Africa, wildlife officials backtracked from earlier statements that they would kill a lion that escaped from Karoo National Park because it was a threat to humans. Those statements were met with an outcry from people who say the lion, dubbed Sylvester in local media, should be captured and relocated. It is the lion's second escape from the park, located in an arid and sparsely populated part of South Africa. \n \n Last year, wildlife staff also labeled the Karoo lion \"Spook\" — \"Ghost\" in the Afrikaans language — because of its ability to stay one step ahead of searchers during its first breakout. \n \n The South African parks service said they are now considering various options, including returning the lion to the park and improving its fencing, moving the lion to another park, donating the lion to a conservation group or killing it if it causes \"massive\" damage — an apparent reference to livestock it may kill — or is a direct threat to humans. \n \n \"Specifically, the loss of human life poses an even greater danger as the animal may lose fear for humans and see them as easy prey,\" the parks service said in a statement. \n \n It said the search for the lion is hampered by difficult terrain and windy conditions that prevented an aerial search. Trackers on foot are also concerned about \"a possible ambush\" by the lion, the statement said. \n \n The 3-year-old male lion escaped several days ago. It is wearing a satellite tracking collar that was installed after last year's escape, during which it eluded capture for more than three weeks and killed 28 sheep, one cow and one kudu antelope. \n \n ___ \n \n Muhumuza reported from Kampala, Uganda. ||||| Kenya's celebrity lion Mohawk is dead. \n \n The most famous lion in Kenya died a horrific, agonising — and many people say senseless — death. He was killed on Wednesday morning by rangers after he strayed from Nairobi National Park. \n \n Mohawk had been tormented for hours before KWS rangers arrived and killed him. \n \n Social media is in an uproar over what is being called the brutal and needless killing of the 13-year-old star attraction, beloved by tourists. Video shows the lion roaring and writhing in pain as he is felled by at nine bullets. \n \n The killing has been described as heinous. \n \n There was no attempt to tranquillise the black-maned lion, known as the \"ladies lion\" because he was often with females. \n \n He was named Mohawk for his distinctive Mohawk-style mane that rose in a tuft from his forehead. \n \n Mohawk had been cornered, surrounded, taunted and stoned for about six hours before he lunged at a passing boda boda rider in Isinya, Kajiado county. The man was knocked down and clawed as the lion tried to flee his tormentors. \n \n Local officials had tried to protect Mohawk until KWS arrived, but a crowd arrived and morans attacked him with arrows and spears. He broke through the crowd and attacked the boda boda in his way. \n \n When KWS rangers arrived, they said they had no choice but to kill him. Tranquilliser darts would take minutes to take effect and in that time the enraged lion might injure others, they said. \n \n Mohawk was just 30km from the park, where he was born. \n \n “We have been here all these hours protecting this lion. The rangers came with guns but we suggested the lion be sedated and taken back to the park. They have spoiled everything by killing the cat. This is wrong,” Isinya deputy county commissioner David Kipkemei told the Star. \n \n About Mohawk \n \n Mohawk was one of 35 lions in Nairobi National Park, one of 2,000 nationwide. He was born in the park in 2003. \n \n He belonged to the King Fisher pride of lions that roamed the Park Forest, King Fisher picnic site, Lion Corner, Maasai Gate and Hyena Dam within the park. \n \n He was the only male seen repeatedly in the company of lionesses. He had a five-year-old companion. \n \n KWS spokesman Paul Udoto said Mohawk was beloved. \n \n \"It is unfortunate the southern part of the park is not fenced. It serves as a seasonal park where animals migrate indifferent seasons. We suspect Mohawk could have moved out through the area,\" Udoto told the Star on the phone. \n \n Also read: Lion guarded six hours, only for KWS rangers to shoot it dead \n \n Resident Jason Parantai had called the Star at 6am, saying the lion had been spotted and residents informed local police. He said the animal was tormented and stressed. \n \n “If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died. You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it, We blame them for this heinous act,” Parantai said. \n \n Environment CS Judi Wakhungu blamed the infrastructure projects at the wedge of Nairobi National Park for the increasing number of stray lions. \n \n Shee said major construction, especially on the Western and Southern part of the park, generate a lot of noise that disturbs the lions that causes them to leave the park. \n \n As a result of construction, all the electric fencing — intended to keep animals inside — has been destroyed. \n \n \"We are working with contractors to ensure they maintain the integrity of the park and keep all animals safe,\" Wakhungu said. \n \n She said though her priority is to safeguard wildlife, talks are underway with the Kenya Railways Corporation and the Transport ministry on how to balance how to balance sustainable management of natural resources and infrastructure development. \n \n Read more on this story: Nairobi Park Diary: The Mohawk walk \n \n Nairobi Park Diary: The Awesome Foursome ||||| 1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The moment a lion is shot dead after attacking a man in Kenya View Photos Wildlife officials in Kenya shot the escaped lion several times after it injured a person in the Kajiado district, said Paul Udoto, a spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service.

AFP/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n Mohawk the lion, one of Kenya’s most famous big cats, was fatally shot Wednesday by wildlife rangers. In a country that has invested millions in protecting its wildlife, Kenyans are trying to figure out what went wrong. \n \n The animal management team that first arrived had no tranquilizers, only rifles. A second, with tranquilizers, was on its way, but the first team killed the animal before arriving because he posed an immediate threat to human life, a spokesman for Kenya Wildlife Services said. \n \n “We lost one of our best lions,” said Nelly Palmeris, a senior park warden at Nairobi National Park. \n \n It turns out that a group of men had surrounded the lion in the town of Isinya, 20 miles from Nairobi, the capital. They took pictures. They threw rocks at him. Finally, Mohawk raised his paw and thrashed one of the men. \n \n Mohawk the Lion, one of Kenya's most famous big cats, was shot and killed Wednesday, March 30 by wildlife rangers. (Reuters) \n \n “When it injured that person, it became imminent to us that it could lead to a worse situation and it had to be brought down,” said Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Gathitu. \n \n In pictures of the shooting, the lion appears to be walking on an unpopulated stretch of farmland when a ranger takes aim, striking the animal's right leg. \n \n “I am outraged, disgusted and grossly disappointed with Kenya Wildlife Services,” Aisha Tande, a Nairobi resident, tweeted. \n \n In Nairobi, Mohawk — with a shock of hair rising from his head — was well known to tourists, a lion that had become accustomed to the sight of safari trucks and camera-toting visitors. He was featured in a local newspaper’s travel article last year. \n \n “Mohawk did not appear to be concerned about all the cars behind him and he continued to walk at a leisurely pace as he enjoyed the freshness of the morning,” Gareth Jones wrote in the Star newspaper. \n \n This was the third time in two months that lions had escaped from Nairobi National Park. One found its way to a military barracks, another to a strip of land near the international airport. \n \n The population around the park has grown more than tenfold since it was established in 1946. Where the lions once would have wandered peacefully, they now encounter suburbs, farms and commercial buildings. If Mohawk hadn’t been surrounded, he wouldn’t have been shot. \n \n He had escaped from Nairobi National Park two days ago, forced out in a territorial dispute with another lion. So he walked south, looking for another place to roam, slipping through an unfenced portion of the park. \n \n In another corner of Africa on Wednesday, another lion was being hunted after escaping from a park. \n \n In South Africa, a lion named Sylvester had escaped from Karoo National Park. Like in Kenya, wildlife officials said he posed a threat. On Wednesday, they prepared to kill him. \n \n “The decision taken earlier today to put him down was not taken lightly,” South African National Parks tweeted. \n \n “He is clearly a troublesome lion and could be a danger to humans,” Reynold Thakhuli, a spokesman for South African National Parks, told the Agence France-Presse. \n \n The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the African lion a “vulnerable” species. A study last year found that its population had declined by 50 percent in the past 20 years. \n \n Read more: \n \n Lions are actually raised to be killed in South Africa.

Citizens used hashtag #JusticeforMohawk to ask why rangers did not tranquilize him instead. \n \n 'Last resort' \n \n Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Udoto said the lion escaped from the Nairobi National Park on Wednesday and ended up in Isinya town, 12 miles away. \n \n Veterinary teams headed to Isinya after they got word on Mohawk's whereabouts. \n \n But noise and commotion from bystanders agitated the animal, prompting it to attack the man.

    "document": "SPARTANBURG, S.C. -- A South Carolina serial killer already serving life in prison for seven slayings told authorities he has two additional victims buried near an interstate, a sheriff said Tuesday. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said investigators are bringing Todd Kohlhepp to the county to lead them to the supposed location of the bodies, the Greenville News reported. \n \n \"We're trying to get a game plan together to find out exactly where and what to do. Investigators have been talking to him,\" Wright said. \"We're not going to try to keep that quiet. We're going to go search.\" \n \n Kohlhepp told investigators that two people are buried near Interstate 26 in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state. Wright is unsure who the supposed additional victims are or exactly where they are, he said. \n \n \"We haven't been able to confirm anything he's claimed yet,\" Wright said. \"It's not to say that the details are not sketchy because it's been so long, but we're obligated to go check.\" \n \n Kohlhepp is serving seven consecutive life sentences without parole at Broad River Correctional Facility in Columbia after pleading guilty to multiple charges in May 2017. \"48 Hours\" investigated the case in the episode, \"Buried Truth.\" \n \n His string of crimes was uncovered in 2016 after police rescued Kala Brown from a storage container where she was chained at the neck and investigators found a body buried in a shallow grave. Brown told investigators she saw Kohlhepp shoot and kill her boyfriend, 32-year-old Charles Carter, who went with her for a cleaning job on Kohlhepp's property in rural Spartanburg County. \n \n Kohlhepp raped Brown while holding her against her will, and told her he had also killed a husband and wife in December 2015, burying their bodies on his land. Johnny Joe Coxie, 29, had been killed immediately, and Kohlhepp kept 26-year-old Meagan Leigh McCraw-Coxie alive for six days before shooting her in the back of the head on Christmas, Solicitor Barry Barnette said. \n \n The Associated Press typically doesn't identify victims of sexual assault, but Brown has spoken publicly about her traumatic experience. \n \n Kohlhepp admitted to her that he had killed four people in the Superbike motorcycle shop in November 2003, the prosecutor said. The owner, Scott Ponder, 30; Beverly Guy, 52; Brian Lucas, 30; and Chris Sherbert, 26 were killed because Kohlhepp thought they were making fun of him. Guy was Ponder's mother and worked as a bookkeeper. Lucas was a service manager, and Sherbert was a mechanic at the shop. \n \n Kohlhepp's crimes took place over more than a decade as he ran a real estate business. \n \n According to the plea agreement signed by Kohlhepp, he will serve seven consecutive life terms plus 60 years on kidnapping, sexual assault and other charges. Kohlhepp will not be eligible for parole, and he also agreed not to appeal the sentence. \n \n Kohlhepp moved to South Carolina in 2001 shortly after 14 years in prison for pleading guilty to kidnapping in Arizona. Authorities there said the then 15-year-old forced a 14-year-old neighbor back to his home at gunpoint, tied her up and raped her. \n \n Friends and co-workers at Kohlhepp's real estate business said he was a hard worker with some strange habits. He would watch pornographic videos during work and joked on his firm's website that he motivated workers by not feeding them. ||||| The Upstate's most notorious serial killer's claim that there were two more bodies buried in Spartanburg County led to a search Wednesday that failed to turn up anything, officials said. \n \n Sheriff Chuck Wright said Tuesday that Todd Kohlhepp claimed the bodies were in the Enoree area. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"He didn't tell me. He didn't tell our investigators. He told somebody who told us,\" Wright told WYFF News 4 Tuesday night. \n \n Lt. Kevin Bobo released the following statement after the search concluded: \n \n “When Todd Kohlhepp was arrested in November, 2016, he made vague statements to our investigators about committing two homicides prior to the Superbike incident. \n \n “At that time, we researched his statement and found no evidence to support his claim. \n \n “Since his incarceration at the S.C. Department of Corrections, he made that same claim to a production company that is filing a documentary about his crimes, but his account to that company differed in some details and also included possible locations of these two alleged victims. \n \n “Last week, two of our investigators went to the Department of Corrections and interviewed Kohlhepp. Some of the details he shared with our investigators differed from what he had shared with the production company; specifically, that the victims were buried in one location as opposed to two different ones. \n \n “Those investigators asked Kohlhepp if he would be willing to show us the location of these two alleged victims. Todd Kohlhepp declined that request. \n \n “Monday and Tuesday, our investigators met with the production company and compared notes to see what was consistent in Kohlhepp’s claims and what wasn’t. That additional research led to numerous deputies and cadaver dogs searching a wooded area at the dead end of a frontage road at Highway 92 and I-26 in Enoree. \n \n “Again, we didn’t find any evidence to support his claim. At present, there aren’t any plans to go back to the site tomorrow, and that lead will be suspended until Kohlhepp decides to share more detailed information that can be verified.” \n \n Maria Awes, senior vice president of Committee Films, confirmed in a statement late Wednesday afternoon that her company is working on the Kohlhepp documentary. \n \n “We are currently on the ground filming an exclusive documentary series about Todd Kohlhepp, airing next year on the true crime and justice channel, Investigation Discovery (ID). \n \n “As this is an active investigation, we are working closely with law enforcement to be completely transparent with our information and filming only within their specified parameters.” \n \n Tuesday, Wright had said he felt like he was \"between a rock and a hard place\" because Kohlhepp killed seven people, so they had to check it out. \n \n The search for more victims \n \n Deputies and K-9's began to search about 9 a.m. \n \n “This will be the last time this happens until he gives me some specifics that I can corroborate, because I don’t want it to be one of those things – he wants to stay relevant,” Wright said. “If he’s got more victims, I promise you, there are no limits to what we won’t do, within the law. I am obligated to see if there are anymore victims here, and if so, we’ll do the best we can to find them, and we’ll work it from there.” \n \n WYFF News 4 \n \n Wright said he didn't want to give more attention to Kohlhepp, but he owed it to the families of possible victims to follow up. \n \n Dozens of vehicles lined the road near the heavily area where the search took place. The film makers who are producing a documentary on Kohlhepp's victims were also at the scene. Wright said he allowed them to shoot the search \"from a distance.\" \n \n He said the nonprofit group Foothills Search and Rescue's dogs were used in the search. Wright said the dogs are capable of finding bodies several feet underground, even if they have been buried for years. \n \n Wright said if they had found any spots they wanted to investigate further, there was an industrial X-ray machine at the scene that is capable of detecting items buried 5 to 7 feet underground. \n \n Kohlhepp is an admitted serial killer \n \n Kohlhepp, 47, is serving seven consecutive life sentences plus an additional 60 years in prison after admitting he killed seven people and sexually assaulted a woman that he held captive in a storage container in November 2016. \n \n Kohlhepp confessed that he killed Beverly Guy, Scott Ponder, Brian Lucas and Chris Sherbert in November 2003 at Superbike Motorsports. \n \n He confessed to the Superbike Motorsports killings after investigators found Kala Brown, a woman who had been reported missing, on Nov. 4, 2016, chained inside a storage container on Kohlhepp’s property in rural Woodruff. \n \n She had been reported missing two months before.

    "document": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hand Grips Clinically Proven Beneficial for Prevention of Low Back Injuries. \n \n \n \n Don't let snow shovelling be a pain in your back. \n \n \n \n Welcome to MOTUS. We manufacture hand grips that offer arthritis and back pain relief and reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries including Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and tendinitis. \n \n \n \n Motus grips are a snow shovel accessory that make snow shovels easier to work with. Use the D-grip and the T-grip on shovels, scoops, pushers and roof rakes. The ergonomic design adjusts to any stature, short or tall, left or right-handed. \n \n The D-grip mounts mid-way down the handle and gives lifting leverage to the forward hand. The T-grip mounts at the upper end of the handle and gives pushing and pulling control to the back hand. In combination, they optimize their mechanical advantage. \n \n \n \n \n \n There are two main actions that take place when working with snow shovels: \n \n \n \n Lifting is involved in the use of snow and scoop shovels. \n \n Biomechanically, lifting involves the body as a third class lever. \n \n Adding the D-grip mid-way down the shovel handle moves the fulcrum to the lower hand, transferring the effort to the long end of the shovel, making it a first class lever. \n \n With increased leverage, the user may now lift a heavier load with greater ease. \n \n Pushing & Pulling is involved in the use of snow pushers and roof rakes. \n \n Adding the D-grip mid-way down the handle improves posture by allowing the user to stand taller with less back bend. \n \n Limb alignment and hand position with the D-grip are more neutral, reducing the risk of repetitive stress injury. \n \n Neutral limb alignment and hand position also reduce fatigue and blisters. \n \n \n \n \n \n Adding the T-grip handle at the upper end allows a greater range of motion. \n \n A straight line of force from the shoulder to the grip opens the space between the shoulders for good posture and reduced risk of back and muscle strain. \n \n Neutral limb alignment and hand position help reduce arthritis and back pain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A Case Study Assessment of MOTUS Power-Grip Products \n \n by Dean Kriellaars, Ph.D., \n \n University of Manitoba, School of Medical Rehabilitation \n \n May 20, 1992 \n \n \n \n I. Description \n \n \n \n Straight Grip (T-grip) \n \n The straight grip provides a fixed hand placement at right angle to the implement shaft. \n \n \n \n D-ring Handle (D-grip) \n \n The d-ring handle provides a hand placement site, which is slightly displaced from the implement shaft. The d-ring can be positioned at any angle relative to the shaft but is typically positioned close to a right angle to the shaft. \n \n \n \n II. Method \n \n \n \n A pseudo-static, biomechanical assessment of the straight grip Power-Grip product was undertaken in case study fashion for a simple shoveling task. The Newtonian equations for static equilibrium were developed to estimate the trunk joint moment required to hold a load with and without the straight hand-grip. A dynamic and EMG analysis was not undertaken. \n \n \n \n III. Results for the Straight Grip \n \n \n \n A. This hand-grip permits the wrist angle to remain in a near neutral position in the ulnar/radial plane. The amount of ulnar deviation is limited to a maximum of 10 degrees as compared to 35 degrees (near the end of range of motion) without the use of the straight grip. \n \n \n \n In lifting with an implement, the wrist can undergo maximum ulnar deviation during a specific period. This results in compression of the tissues located on the ulnar side of the wrist (the ulnar nerve, blood supply, carpal ligaments, tendons, etc.) and tension in the radially located tissues. Prolonged or repetitive loading of a joint at the end of range of motion can be deleterious to the tissues. In the mid-range of a joint, the muscles can operate efficiently to bear the load, however, in the end of range of motion, the passive tissues bear a disproportionate amount of the load since the muscles are in a compromised position. The decreased ulnar deviation resulting from the use of the straight grip is beneficial to the structures in and about the wrist. \n \n \n \n B. The hand-grip requires the forearm to be in a pronated position. \n \n \n \n Without the use of the straight grip, the forearm would be in a supinated position. This positioning influences the set of muscles recruited to perform the task. Most notably, with the forearm in a supinated position, the biceps brachii can operate to control the amount of supination and is in an advantaged position to aid in elbow flexion. When the straight grip is used, the forearm is positioned in pronation. This positioning results in a different muscle strategy to be employed during the lifting task. The biceps brachii is positioned in a relatively lengthened position and the forearm extensors and forearm supinators are required to control the degree of pronation. The difference in lifting with the straight grip represents a substitution of muscles required to perform the task. An electromyographical analysis would be required to establish the precise muscle activation pattern. This may limit the amount of elbow flexion used to perform the task enabling the user to incorporate larger trunk and lower limb musculature. \n \n \n \n C. The change in wrist position and forearm pronation results in an increased shoulder abduction angle (5-10 degrees). \n \n \n \n The change in wrist position requires the shoulder to be abducted. The lifting task normally involves the use of shoulder abductors. When the straight grip is used the starting angle for the abduction movement is greater. The change in joint angle would alter the muscle activation pattern required to perform the task. It is possible to speculate that the supraspinatus muscle, which is claimed to account for the first 5 degrees of abduction, would not be involved in the abduction when the straight grip is employed, instead the larger deltoid muscles would be primarily involved. This may result in a decreased likelihood of tendinitis (or similar disorder) of the intrinsic shoulder muscles. This speculation would have to be examined with electromyographical analysis. \n \n \n \n D. The change in upper limb kinematics (joint angles) due to the hand-grip reduces the trunk flexion angle in the neighborhood of 5 degrees. \n \n \n \n The kinematics of the upper limb holding on to the straight grip allows the trunk to remain in a more upright position during a lifting task. This results in a decreased effort from the extensor muscles of the hip and back since they do not have to work as hard to hold up the weight of the trunk. These muscles do not have to work as hard since there is i) a decrease in the moment of the weight of the upper body due to a decrease in the moment arm, and ii) a decrease in the moment of the weight of the load (that being lifted) due to a decrease in the moment arm are (the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the weight force acting vertically downward to the specific axis of rotation, say the L4 vertebral axis). This decrease in the moment of the load and upper body weight would be in the order of 5%. For repetitive tasks this small decrease would result in substantial energy savings and may result in less cumulative trauma. \n \n \n \n \n \n E. The change in upper body kinematics (joint angles) allows the load borne by the implement to be carried closer (about 5 cm) in the para-sagittal plane to the joint axes of rotation, most notable the hip and lumbar vertebral axes, as well as the upper limb axes (shoulder and elbow). \n \n \n \n Similar to point D., when the lifted load is carried closer to the body this results in a decrease in the moment arm of the load relative to the body's axes of rotation (hip, lumbar, shoulder, etc.). The decrease in moment arm reduces the tendency of the load to rotate downward which proportionately relieves the muscles from having to rotate the load upward. The magnitude of this effect is between 3 and 5 %. \n \n \n \n The overall reduction in load arising from the decrease in trunk angle and the closer load carrying is near 10%. This is a substantial amount, not only for repetitive tasks, but also for a single execution of a task. This would be beneficial for prevention and rehabilitation of low back injuries. \n \n \n \n \n \n F. The hand-grip did not result in an observable change in lower limb kinematics. \n \n \n \n The method employed in this study did not permit accurate evaluation of lower limb kinematics. A video motion analysis would be required for this purpose. \n \n \n \n \n \n G. The hand-grip constrains the user to a specific set of lifting postures. \n \n \n \n This constraint arises from the fact that the user must hold the grip and since the grip is fixed on the implement shaft the user's upper limbs are required to maintain a fixed geometry during lifting. Any task executed repetitively results in specific muscle fatigue, as such it may be beneficial to allow the user to rest or the freedom to adopt different postures to perform the same task which results in a substitution of non-fatigued muscles for the fatiguing muscles. This factor is primarily related to user understanding of proper lifting concepts and is not actually limited by the straight grip (i.e. changing the position of the straight grip periodically). \n \n \n \n \n \n H. The straight grip was found to fit any of the 14 different implements tested independent of: \n \n \n \n 1. material (plastic, metal or wood), \n \n 2. shaft diameter \n \n 3. the presence of water (rain). \n \n \n \n The straight grip was found to loosen or tighten somewhat with variations in temperature. The user would be advised to check that the grip is secure before each use. \n \n \n \n \n \n I. The hand-grip reduces the potential for blister formation. \n \n \n \n The kinematics of lifting without the hand-grip involves movement of the hand relative to the shaft resulting in skin surface shear which leads to blistering. With the use of the straight grip the magnitude of skin surface shear may be less which would result in a decrease in blister formation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CASE STUDY ASSESSMENT SUMMARY \n \n \"hand-grip permits the wrist angle to remain in a near neutral position\"...\"beneficial to the structures in and about the wrist.\" \n \n \"enabling the user to incorporate larger trunk and lower limb musculature.\" \n \n \"decreased likelihood of tendinitis (or similar disorder) of the intrinsic shoulder muscles\" \n \n \"remain in a more upright position during a lifting task\"...\"substantial energy savings and may result in less cumulative trauma.\" \n \n \"The overall reduction in load arising from the decrease in trunk angle and the closer load carrying is near 10%.

Typically it's posed by a woman standing with hands on hips and assuming a Thurberesque mien as she gazes down on a man exercising his thumb on the remote but otherwise in repose. The correct answer: \"It might.\" \n \n Snow-shovel design may not rank up there with the Three Gorges Dam as an engineering challenge, but it kills more than 10 times as many people each year. My Slate colleague Juliet Lapidos has observed that the 1,200 annual heart-failure deaths attributed to blizzards represent only about 0.3 percent of all annual deaths from heart disease. But that's a lot more people than die from watching a football game (though that poses health risks too). You can say all these shovelers should exercise more, and that's certainly true. But such advice is of little help to a sedentary soul whose doorstep is suddenly buried in a four-foot drift. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n The science of shoveling was invented by the Progressive Era efficiency expert (and father of Taylorism) Frederick Winslow Taylor. Taylor observed laborers shoveling varying weights and concluded that the shovel load with which \"a first class man would do his biggest day's work\" was about 21 pounds. That's remarkably close to the current recommendation from Canada's Center for Occupational Health and Safety (keep per-shovel snow loads below 24 pounds). At the Bethlehem Steel works in Pennsylvania, Taylor gave out shovels specifically designed to hold 21 pounds—small ones for shoveling iron ore, big ones for shoveling ash—and made \"thousands of stop-watch observations\" to calculate the most efficient shoveling method. \n \n Taylor's purpose was not to preserve workers' health but to maximize output; by following his recommendations, Bethlehem was able to increase the daily weight shoveled by each laborer from 16 to 59 tons. But because physical endurance was a necessary component to maximizing output, Taylor's shoveling method also reduced wear and tear on the human body. \"[T]his is not nigger driving,\" Taylor said (that's how Progressives talked in 1911); \"this is kindness; this is teaching; this is doing what I would like mighty well to have done to me if I were a boy trying to learn how to do something.\" He recommended that workers \n \n press the forearm hard against the upper part of the right leg, just below the thigh … take the end of the shovel in your right hand and when you push the shovel into the pile, instead of using the muscular effort of your arms, which is tiresome, throw the weight on the body of the shovel … [T]hat pushes your shovel in the pile with hardly any exertion and without tiring the arms in the least. \n \n Reading Taylor's recommendations, one is struck by two significant changes in American life. One is that 100 years later African-Americans are considered human beings whose physical well-being concerns society (at least in theory) as much as that of Caucasians. The other change is that, even taking into account that Taylor's subjects were all experienced manual laborers, people must have had much stronger backs back then. \n \n Like Slate on Facebook.

    "summary": "– If you live in America, there’s a good chance you’re shoveling snow today—or will be soon—but beware: The dreaded chore can actually kill you. How to avoid such a tragic fate? Well, for starters, keep your per-shovel load to 24 pounds or less. Beyond that, however, the recommendations get muddled, notes Timothy Noah on Slate: Shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow, and vice versa. There is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job, but good luck finding one in a hardware store. A few other things will lessen your risk: Don’t start shoveling while snow is still falling (it’s colder, so you’ll put additional strain on your heart); don’t bundle up too much (getting too hot isn’t good, either); and don’t drink coffee (it increases your heart rate) or hot cocoa (who knows why?) right before shoveling. If that all sounds like too much trouble, “wait till someone younger or poorer than you knocks on your door and offers to shovel your walk for $20 or $30,” Noah recommends. “Delegate. The economy will benefit and your cardiologist will thank you.”"

    "document": "News Corp. says it will close its 168-year-old U.K. tabloid News of the World, a dramatic bid to cap a scandal centered on the paper's controversial reporting tactics in pursuit of racy scoops. \n \n News Of The World was known for years of hard-hitting investigations, exposure of wrongdoing, campaigning - and a hefty dose of celebrity gossip. Video courtesy of Sky News. \n \n The paper, which appears on Sundays, is accused of improperly intercepting voice mails of everyday people, including a 13-year-old murder victim, as well as those of celebrities. \n \n James Murdoch, News Corp.'s deputy chief operating officer, told staff Thursday that News Corp. had decided to close the tabloid because the allegations—if true—were \"inhuman\" and had no place in the company. He said the paper's reputation had been \"sullied by behavior that was wrong.\" \n \n The paper is one of Britain's sauciest and most storied tabloids, and was a key building block in the global media empire created by News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch, who purchased it in 1969. News Corp. also owns The Wall Street Journal. \n \n News of the World became the U.K.'s best-selling Sunday paper with a righteous, no-holds-barred approach to taking down the rich and famous, from politicians to soccer stars. That style both appealed to the U.K.'s working class and titillated sophisticates who bought it as a guilty pleasure. \n \n View Slideshow Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Chief executive of News International, Rebekah Brooks. \n \n The paper has been under immense pressure for five years amid investigations into the use of private detectives to break into the mobile-phone voice mail of celebrities and political leaders. \n \n The public rebuke reached a new level this week with the allegation that, in 2002, the paper accessed the voice mail of an abducted 13-year-old girl who, it turned out, had been murdered. Other allegations then surfaced of hacking into phones tied to other child-murder victims, as well as the families of war dead and of victims of 2005 terrorist attacks in London. \n \n A person familiar with the matter said James Murdoch proposed the closure to his father earlier this week, and the idea was pursued immediately. \n \n \"The News of the World is in the business of holding others to account,\" the younger Mr. Murdoch said. \"But it failed when it came to itself.\" He said the final News of the World would be published Sunday. \n \n The controversy thrusts the younger Mr. Murdoch, believed to be a contender to eventually run News Corp., to the front and center of crisis management. \n \n A sense that the paper had betrayed its readership was evident in London on Thursday night. Kandice Kameka, an office manager who works near the paper's offices, said she bought the paper \"depending on what was on the front page—how good the gossip was.\" But she added: \"When I found out about the tapping with the murder victim I was just gobsmacked—I didn't want anything to do with it after that....They just have no respect for people.\" \n \n News of the World, Through the Years View Slideshow Getty Images A printer studied a front page proof in 1953. View Graphics Read All About It Key dates in the paper's past View Graphics \n \n The recent uproar has threatened one of the most important business transactions on News Corp.'s plate, its proposed buyout of the 60.9% of British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC that it doesn't already own. \n \n Before this week, the company was poised to finally receive regulatory approval for that proposal after an arduous 13-month effort; now that approval may be delayed, and it is unclear whether the deal itself will wind up as collateral damage in the News of the World scandal. \n \n Analysts said the closure of News of the World would have a trivial impact on News Corp.'s finances. The paper accounts for significantly less than half of News Corp.'s U.K. publishing operations, which are valued at about $1.3 billion, or 2.8% of News Corp.'s current market cap, according to a person familiar with the matter. News Corp. shares rose almost 2% on the Nasdaq Stock Market Thursday before finishing at $17.43, down four cents. \n \n Closing the paper by no means will shut down the scandal that has engulfed News Corp.'s U.K. newspaper operations. The company still faces a thicket of criminal investigations, civil lawsuits and new government and police probes that could take years to run their course. \n \n News Corp. said it would close its News of the World weekly tabloid after a phone-hacking scandal, with this coming Sunday's edition the newspaper's last. \n \n Executives of News Corp. believe more arrests are likely, according to people familiar with the matter. On Thursday night, the Guardian newspaper said Andy Coulson—a former News of the World editor who later became an aide to Prime Minister David Cameron—was told by police to present himself for arrest on Friday on suspicion of offenses related to phone hacking during his time as editor. Mr. Coulson didn't respond to a request for comment. \n \n The situation has led to calls for the resignation of Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International, News Corp.'s U.K. newspaper unit, who so far has received the backing of the elder Mr. Murdoch as well as his son. \n \n Ms. Brooks was News of the World's editor until 2003, during the time of the alleged hacking of the murdered girl's phone. Since then, she has become one of the elder Mr. Murdoch's top lieutenants. \n \n The latest revelations unleashed a political storm that prompted Mr. Cameron—a friend of Ms. Brooks—to call for new investigations into the paper's reporting tactics, the failures of the police and British media practices in general. Late Thursday, Downing Street officials were quick to say Mr. Cameron had nothing to do with the move to shut the paper. \n \n Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said that Ms. Brooks should still step down. \"I don't think News International can hope to start moving on and deal with these issues while she remains in place,\" he said. \n \n Ms. Brooks declined to comment through a spokeswoman. \n \n News Corp.'s move to close News of the World—which has an average circulation of 2.7 million, according to tracking organization ABC—brought sharp criticism from the U.K.'s National Union of Journalists. It is one of News Corp.'s four major U.K. newspaper titles, the others being the Sun, the Times and Sunday Times, but its circulation has been declining in recent years. \n \n Michelle Stanistreet, the union's deputy general secretary, said a handful of staffers from the tabloid's sister paper, the Sun, left work in solidarity with their News of the World colleagues on Thursday, but that no strikes were planned. She said the closure was an attempt to divert attention, and the younger Mr. Murdoch should have fired Ms. Brooks instead. \n \n News International said Thursday that some of the paper's 200 staff members may be laid off. But some may be transferred to other titles. \n \n News Corp. may not be without a Sunday tabloid in the U.K. for long: people familiar with the matter said it has considered adding a Sunday edition to the six-days-a-week Sun, which attracts a similar audience as News of the World. The company could also simply launch a new paper with a different name. \n \n \"We don't know if this is anything more than a bit of PR management,\" said Tamsin Allen, a partner at law firm Bindmans LLP representing alleged phone-hack victims. \"It's not really until we see heads rolling that we can be convinced that the company is taking this sufficiently seriously.\" \n \n The phone-hacking scandal dates back to 2005, when Prince William's staff first alerted authorities to the possibility that the News of the World had hacked phones connected to the prince, sparking a police inquiry. \n \n An initial police investigation into the newspaper resulted in two successful prosecutions that led to prison terms for the paper's royal-family correspondent, Clive Goodman, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator hired by the tabloid. \n \n Mr. Coulson, News of the World's editor at the time, resigned from his post in 2007, saying he took responsibility for the hacking that occurred on his watch but stating that he didn't know about it. The scandal reignited after new information surfaced in civil suits and the police reopened their criminal investigation. \n \n —Alistair MacDonald, Natalia Rachlin and Jessica E.
